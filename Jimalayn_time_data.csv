Some of nearly 300 abducted schoolchildren in Nigeria's north are freed after weeks in captivity,By Associated Press,"05:22 pm Mar 24, 2024",Himalayn times,"ABUJA, MARCH 24 At least 137 of nearly 300 Nigerian children abducted more than two weeks ago from their school in the northwestern state of Kaduna were released on Sunday, the West African nation's military said. Related Articles More than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel-Hamas war, Gaza Health Ministry says First US lunar lander in more than 50 years launched but develops problem on way to moon An earlier statement from the government suggested that all the students were freed. Motorcycle-riding gunmen invaded the Kuriga school on March 7 and marched the children into the forests before security forces could arrive, as terrified families watched helplessly. School authorities said a total of 287 students were kidnapped during the attack, at least 100 of them are aged 12 or younger. At least 1,400 students have been kidnapped from Nigerian schools since 2014, when Boko Haram militants seized hundreds of schoolgirls from Borno state's Chibok village. In recent years, abductions have been concentrated in the country's northwestern and central regions, where dozens of armed groups often target villagers and travelers for ransom. The 137 children were rescued in Zamfara state, an enclave known for kidnappings more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) away from their school, Nigerian military spokesman Maj. Gen. Edward Buba said in a statement. ""Efforts would continue until other hostages are found and the terrorists arrested, tried, and brought to justice by Nigerian law,"" Buba said. At least 17 other schoolchildren in northern Sokoto state were also rescued two weeks after they were taken hostage, according to a statement issued Saturday by the Sokoto state government. Kaduna state Gov. Uba Sani, who first announced the rescue, did not give details about the operation. His office could not be reached Sunday to clarify the discrepancy in the number of those freed. The Associated Press could not reach villagers in Kuriga town, where mobile network is not available. Under growing pressure to end the mass kidnappings in northern Nigeria, President Bola Tinubu promised his administration is ""deploying detailed strategies to ensure that our schools remain safe sanctuaries of learning, not lairs for wanton abductions."" Tinubu had vowed to rescue the children ""without paying a dime"" as ransom. But ransoms are commonly paid for kidnappings, often arranged by families, and it is rare for officials in Nigeria to admit to the payments. No group has claimed responsibility for the Kaduna kidnapping, which locals have blamed on bandit groups known for mass killings and kidnappings for ransom in the conflict-battered northern region, most of them former herders in conflict with settled communities. At least two people with extensive knowledge of the security crisis in Nigeria's northwest told AP that the identity of the abductors is known. Murtala Ahmed Rufa'i, a professor of peace and conflict studies at Usmanu Danfodiyo University, and Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, a cleric who has negotiated with the bandits, said they were hiding in the region's vast and ungoverned forests. Arrests are rare in Nigeria's mass kidnappings, as victims are usually released only after desperate families pay ransoms or through deals with government and security officials. #Nigeria school kidnapping",https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/some-of-nearly-300-abducted-schoolchildren-in-nigerias-north-are-freed-after-weeks-in-captivity,world

This spring, a total of 7 Nepali students - 2 for undergraduate, 3 for master's and 2 for doctoral degree – will be proceeding to Japan to obtain their degrees. On the occasion, Ambassador Kikuta congratulated the successfully selected MEXT scholarship students and expressed his hope that they would make their best efforts in a good learning environment in Japan. The Ambassador also encouraged the students to venture out of the university to experience various aspects of Japanese culture, make Japanese friends, and deeply understand the spirit of Japanese people. He stated that he believes that with the knowledge, experience, and Japanese spirit thus acquired, the students will contribute to Nepal's development and play an important role in Japan-Nepal relations in the future. Dr. Sunil Babu Shrestha, the president of Japanese Universities Alumni Association, Nepal (JUAAN) also offered fruitful advice to the students about life and university in Japan, as he himself had experienced them.

The 137 children were rescued in Zamfara state, an enclave known for kidnappings more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) away from their school, Nigerian military spokesman Maj. Gen. Edward Buba said in a statement. ""Efforts would continue until other hostages are found and the terrorists arrested, tried, and brought to justice by Nigerian law,"" Buba said. At least 17 other schoolchildren in northern Sokoto state were also rescued two weeks after they were taken hostage, according to a statement issued Saturday by the Sokoto state government. Kaduna state Gov. Uba Sani, who first announced the rescue, did not give details about the operation. His office could not be reached Sunday to clarify the discrepancy in the number of those freed. The Associated Press could not reach villagers in Kuriga town, where mobile network is not available. Under growing pressure to end the mass kidnappings in northern Nigeria, President Bola Tinubu promised his administration is ""deploying detailed strategies to ensure that our schools remain safe sanctuaries of learning, not lairs for wanton abductions."" Tinubu had vowed to rescue the children ""without paying a dime"" as ransom. But ransoms are commonly paid for kidnappings, often arranged by families, and it is rare for officials in Nigeria to admit to the payments. No group has claimed responsibility for the Kaduna kidnapping, which locals have blamed on bandit groups known for mass killings and kidnappings for ransom in the conflict-battered northern region, most of them former herders in conflict with settled communities. At least two people with extensive knowledge of the security crisis in Nigeria's northwest told AP that the identity of the abductors is known. Murtala Ahmed Rufa'i, a professor of peace and conflict studies at Usmanu Danfodiyo University, and Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, a cleric who has negotiated with the bandits, said they were hiding in the region's vast and ungoverned forests. Arrests are rare in Nigeria's mass kidnappings, as victims are usually released only after desperate families pay ransoms or through deals with government and security officials. #Nigeria school kidnapping",https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/some-of-nearly-300-abducted-schoolchildren-in-nigerias-north-are-freed-after-weeks-in-captivity,world

Spiritual excavation of intangible heritages: Just as important as tangible ones,By Ram Achal Yadav,"12:31 pm Mar 24, 2024",Himalayn times,"As both the treasures, tangible and intangible ones, play a crucial role towards enriching our cultural legacy that advances human capital, cultivating peace and harmony from within, these intangible heritages cherishing immense spiritual values deep within also need to be discovered, harvested, presented, preserved and promoted like the tangible heritages. Time has thus come for the spiritual excavation and exploration to discover the vast intangibly tangible cultural as well as spiritual heritage and harvest its very essence that went into oblivion down the centuries after the sack of Kapilavastu Kapilavastu of Ancient Shakya Kingdom cherishes beneath it not only the tangible archaeological remains but also a vast intangibly tangible cultural and spiritual treasure. With its sack that resulted in the massacre of a great number of Shakyas, ""Kapilavastu"" gradually disappeared from the world's physical map, and its legacy went into oblivion in the history down the ages. The search for ""Kapilavastu"", the lost capital city of ancient Shakya Kingdom, began from the first millennia CE. In this course, as a part of their pilgrimage, prominent Chinese pilgrims Faxian and Zuanzang visited ancient Kapilavastu in the 5th and 7th CE, respectively and mentioned in their travelogue the details regarding the whereabouts and locations of ""Kapilavastu "" as well as distances from one heritage to another along with other socio-economic, cultural and geographical features. PC Mukherjee, representing the Indian archaeological survey team, visited Kapilavastu as a part of his archaeological exploration mission in the western terai region of Nepal, and rediscovered the ancient capital city of Kapilavastu in 1899 AD. tracing the details described in the travelogues by the Chinese pilgrims. As soon as the news spread about the discovery of the lost ancient capital city of Kapilavastu, people from around the world started visiting ""Tilaurakot-Kapilavastu"" as well as other important archaeological and cultural heritage sites of the ancient Shakya Kingdom. And archaeological explorations and excavations at archaeologically potential sites within and around the ancient capital city of Kapilavastu commenced as well in order to further investigate and gather more and more meaningful and convincing evidences towards satisfying the requirements for ""Tilaurakot"" to be officially recognised as the actual ancient capital city of Kapilavastu. As a result of a series of scientific investigations and excavations carried out by different teams of technical experts at different periods and time frame representing the Archaeological Survey of India, Risho University, Japan, ISMEO, Italy and Durham University, UK in collaboration with the Department of Archaeology, Lumbini Development Trust, Government of Nepal, ample evidence was discovered that helped the Government of Nepal to submit the final nomination dossier to UNESCO in order for ""Tilaurakot"" to be granted world heritage status. Thus, efforts towards discovering tangible archaeological heritages in Kapilavastu have been noticeably successful though there is still much left to be done with regard to excavating, identifying, presenting, preserving and promoting most of out of over 136 archaeological as well as cultural heritage sites situated throughout Kapilavastu district itself that makes the district an open museum. Besides, institutional initiatives with practicable strategies and measures are the need of the hour as well in order to be able to discover the vast intangible cultural as well as spiritual heritages and harvest the very essence they cherish deep within. As both the treasures, tangible and intangible ones, play a crucial role towards enriching our cultural legacy that advances human capital, cultivating peace and harmony from within, these intangible heritages cherishing immense spiritual values deep within also need to be discovered, harvested, presented, preserved and promoted like the tangible heritages. Ancient Kapilavastu, the hermitage of sage Kapilamuni, the sacred land of Bodhisattvas and Tathagat Buddha, cherishes in its heart the very ""grace and divine energy"" of the Buddha, as well as the unwavering perseverance, dedication, devotion, sacrifices and incredible contribution of Queen Mothers: Mayadevi and Mahaprajapati Gautami, Crown Princess Yashodhara, Prince Rahul, King Suddhodana, Horse Kanthaka, as well as many others of Kapilavastu. Time has come for the spiritual excavation and exploration to discover the vast intangibly tangible cultural as well as spiritual heritage and harvest its very essence that went into oblivion down the centuries after the sack of Kapilavastu. It is high time that the history be revisited, cultural legacy be enlivened and the very essence of the vast cultural and spiritual heritage cherished in the heart of Ancient Kapilavastu be harvested and offered to the whole world as the very gift of the ancient wisdom from the world cultural and spiritual heritage zone so that the entire humanity can benefit immensely from them.

Only 27pc population has access to pure drinking water,By Rastriya Samachar Samiti,"04:45 pm Mar 23, 2024",Himalayn times,"KATHMANDU, MARCH 23 It is found that only 27 per cent of the total population of the country has access to pure drinking water, according to the Ministry of Water Supply and Sanitation. Related Articles 20 per cent people living below poverty line, Statistics Office says Water birds of 41 species found in Narayani river area Seventy-three per cent of the population is deprived of this facility in lack of minerals including iron in water sources owing to the dilapidated water pipeline and water tank of more than 100 years. Sources of drinking water become more polluted during times of natural disasters like landslide and flood which affects people's health. According to doctors, drinking unfiltered and untreated water due to lack of public awareness has serious impact on public health. Under-Secretary at the Ministry, Madhu Timalsena, said the ministry was working to increase people's access to pure drinking water. Problem has surfaced in distribution of clean drinking water as water sources have become polluted due to distribution of water from pipelines installed some120 years ago, he shared. Timalsena, however, urged people in Kathmandu to drink water supplied by Melamchi drinking water project without any doubt as it is in accordance with standards of the World Health Organisation. He suggested to drinking underground water only after testing it as the iron content in the underground water is generally high. People can suffer from different diseases and infections like diarrhoea, vomiting, jaundice, typhoid and cholera as well as the high risk of hepatitis 'A' and 'E' due to consumption of polluted drinking water, shared doctors. Similarly, infectious disease Specialist Dr Sher Bahadur Pun suggested one and all to drink water only after purifying or boiling it, stating that serious problems might arise in public health due to consumption of contaminated water. ""Back 20 years ago, people used to die suffering from cholera due to drinking polluted water. People are losing their lives due to consumption of polluted water even these days,"" he said, referring to the lack of access to pure drinking water. According to Dr Pun, water is more polluted after monsoon-induced disasters like floods and landslides, and drinking the polluted water will cause water-borne communicable diseases as cholera, diahhroea, hepatitis, dysentery and others. Public health expert Dr Sameer Adhikari warned against using contaminated water in view of the public health. He suggested keeping the water sources clean and drinking boiled water and using clean water to wash fruits and vegetables. Rajendra Aryal, the President of Federation of Drinking Water and Sanitation Users Nepal, said the constitution has made provision that all citizens have the right to potable drinking water as their fundamental right. However, he complained that this fundamental right was not implemented in an effective manner. Aryal called on the government to give priority, in the budget for the upcoming fiscal year 2024/25, to programmes related to access to quality drinking water to all. ""Still many consumers have to line up for hours to collect water, and on top of this, they do not have access to pure water. Programmes for distributing clean drinking water should be moved ahead through collaboration among all the three tiers of the government,"" he emphasized. As per the National Census Report, 2021, 34.6 percent of the total 6 million 660 thousand and 841 households use taps/pipe water within the premises of their homes while 22.4 percent used taps/pipe water outside of the premises of their homes and 29.8 percent used water from tube well/hand pump. Similarly, the Report states that 1.5 percent of the total 6 million 660 thousand and 841 households used water drawn from covered wells, 3.9 percent used water from spring taps while 4.6 percent used jar and bottle water. It is stated in the report that 2.1 percent of the total 6 million 660 thousand and 841 households use open well water as their main source of water while 0.4 percent used water directly collected from river and streams. In this context, the government has also adopted the Global Sustainable Development Goal 6 to ensure the availability and sustainability management of water and sanitation for all. By 2030, the government aims to increase the number of people using safe drinking water to at least 90%. Similarly, UNICEF's new country programme (2018-2022) in Nepal initiated efforts in WASH programmes to secure enhanced and equitable access to safe and sustainable drinking water, sanitation services, and improved hygiene practices for children and their families. This programme is guided by WASH Sector Development Plan (2016 - 2030). It supports improving water quality through strengthening the water regulatory body, implementing water safety plans, and raising community awareness on household-level water treatment. #drinking water",https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/only-27pc-population-has-access-to-pure-drinking-water,nepal

Russia detains suspects in an attack that left at least 115 dead in a Moscow concert hall,By Associated Press,"04:38 pm Mar 23, 2024",Himalayn times,"MOSCOW, MARCH 23 Russian authorities detained 11 people, state media reported Saturday, after gunmen stormed a concert hall in Moscow in a grisly attack that left at least 115 people dead. Related Articles At least 26 dead and 11 missing after flash floods and landslides on Indonesia's Sumatra island Rock band critical of Putin is detained in Thailand, fearful of deportation to Russia Russia's Investigative Committee said four of those detained were directly involved in the attack that left the sprawling shopping mall and music venue smoldering with a collapsed roof. Russian agencies appeared to suggest the attack was linked to Ukraine even though the Islamic State group claimed responsibility in a statement. A U.S. intelligence official told The Associated Press that U.S. agencies had confirmed that that group was responsible for the attack. The four suspects were stopped in the Bryansk region of western Russia, ""not far from the border with Ukraine,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said. They planned to cross the border into Ukraine and ""had contacts"" there, state news agency Tass said, citing Russia's FSB. The head of the FSB briefed President Vladimir Putin on the arrests on Saturday, according to Tass. The attack came just days after Putin cemented his grip on power in a highly orchestrated electoral landslide. The attack was the deadliest in Russia in years and came as the country's fight in Ukraine dragged into a third year. Shortly after the attack, some Russian lawmakers pointed the finger at Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, denied any involvement. ""Ukraine has never resorted to the use of terrorist methods,"" he posted on X, formerly Twitter. ""Everything in this war will be decided only on the battlefield."" Images shared by Russian state media Saturday showed a fleet of emergency vehicles still gathered outside the ruins of Crocus City Hall, which had a capacity of more than 6,000 people in Krasnogorsk, on Moscow's western edge. Videos posted online showed gunmen in the venue shooting civilians at point-blank range. The roof of the theater, where crowds had gathered Friday for a performance by the Russian rock band Picnic, collapsed in the early hours of Saturday morning as firefighters spent hours fighting a fire that erupted during the attack. In a statement posted by its Aamaq news agency, the Islamic State's affiliate in Afghanistan said it had attacked a large gathering of ""Christians"" in Krasnogorsk. It was not immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the claim. A U.S. intelligence official told the AP that U.S. intelligence agencies had gathered information in recent weeks that the IS branch was planning an attack in Moscow, and that U.S. officials had privately shared the intelligence earlier this month with Russian officials. The official was briefed on the matter but was not authorized to publicly discuss the intelligence information and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Messages of outrage, shock and support for those affected have since streamed in from around the world. On Friday, the U.N. Security Council condemned ""the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack"" and underlined the need for the perpetrators to be held accountable. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the terrorist attack ""in the strongest possible terms,"" his spokesman said. Meanwhile, in Moscow itself, hundreds of people stood in line Saturday morning to donate blood and plasma, Russia's health ministry said. Putin, who extended his grip on Russia for another six years in this week's presidential vote after a sweeping crackdown on dissent, had publicly denounced the Western warnings of a potential terrorist attack as an attempt to intimidate Russians. ""All that resembles open blackmail and an attempt to frighten and destabilize our society,"" he said earlier this week. In October 2015, a bomb planted by the Islamic State downed a Russian passenger plane over Sinai, killing all 224 people on board, most of them Russian vacation-goers returning from Egypt. The group, which operates mainly in Syria and Iraq but also in Afghanistan and Africa, also has claimed several attacks in Russia's volatile Caucasus and other regions in the past years. It recruited fighters from Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. #Moscow terrorist attack #concert hall",https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/russia-detains-suspects-in-an-attack-that-left-at-least-115-dead-in-a-moscow-concert-hall,world

"Russia attacks Ukrainian electrical power facilities, including major hydroelectric plant",By Associated Press,"03:27 pm Mar 22, 2024",Himalayn times,"KYIV, MARCH 22 Russia attacked electrical power facilities in much of Ukraine, including the country's largest hydroelectric plant, causing widespread outages and killing at least three people, officials said Friday. Related Articles Putin is set to win 6 more years in power. Here's how it will affect the war and Russia's relations Ukrainian troops pull back again as Russia's onslaught pushes ahead in eastern Ukraine Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system."" The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation. The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said. The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident. The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed. One person was killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional governor Ivan Fedorov. Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry. ""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app. Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border. The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit. Both regions have been subject to shelling and drone attacks in recent weeks and officials have said that attempts by Ukrainian fighters to cross into Russian territory have been repelled. #Russia-Ukraine war",https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/russia-attacks-ukrainian-electrical-power-facilities-including-major-hydroelectric-plant,world

Only 27pc population has access to pure drinking water,By Rastriya Samachar Samiti,"04:45 pm Mar 23, 2024",Himalayn times,"KATHMANDU, MARCH 23 It is found that only 27 per cent of the total population of the country has access to pure drinking water, according to the Ministry of Water Supply and Sanitation. Related Articles 20 per cent people living below poverty line, Statistics Office says Water birds of 41 species found in Narayani river area Seventy-three per cent of the population is deprived of this facility in lack of minerals including iron in water sources owing to the dilapidated water pipeline and water tank of more than 100 years. Sources of drinking water become more polluted during times of natural disasters like landslide and flood which affects people's health. According to doctors, drinking unfiltered and untreated water due to lack of public awareness has serious impact on public health. Under-Secretary at the Ministry, Madhu Timalsena, said the ministry was working to increase people's access to pure drinking water. Problem has surfaced in distribution of clean drinking water as water sources have become polluted due to distribution of water from pipelines installed some120 years ago, he shared. Timalsena, however, urged people in Kathmandu to drink water supplied by Melamchi drinking water project without any doubt as it is in accordance with standards of the World Health Organisation. He suggested to drinking underground water only after testing it as the iron content in the underground water is generally high. People can suffer from different diseases and infections like diarrhoea, vomiting, jaundice, typhoid and cholera as well as the high risk of hepatitis 'A' and 'E' due to consumption of polluted drinking water, shared doctors. Similarly, infectious disease Specialist Dr Sher Bahadur Pun suggested one and all to drink water only after purifying or boiling it, stating that serious problems might arise in public health due to consumption of contaminated water. ""Back 20 years ago, people used to die suffering from cholera due to drinking polluted water. People are losing their lives due to consumption of polluted water even these days,"" he said, referring to the lack of access to pure drinking water. According to Dr Pun, water is more polluted after monsoon-induced disasters like floods and landslides, and drinking the polluted water will cause water-borne communicable diseases as cholera, diahhroea, hepatitis, dysentery and others. Public health expert Dr Sameer Adhikari warned against using contaminated water in view of the public health. He suggested keeping the water sources clean and drinking boiled water and using clean water to wash fruits and vegetables. Rajendra Aryal, the President of Federation of Drinking Water and Sanitation Users Nepal, said the constitution has made provision that all citizens have the right to potable drinking water as their fundamental right. However, he complained that this fundamental right was not implemented in an effective manner. Aryal called on the government to give priority, in the budget for the upcoming fiscal year 2024/25, to programmes related to access to quality drinking water to all. ""Still many consumers have to line up for hours to collect water, and on top of this, they do not have access to pure water. Programmes for distributing clean drinking water should be moved ahead through collaboration among all the three tiers of the government,"" he emphasized. As per the National Census Report, 2021, 34.6 percent of the total 6 million 660 thousand and 841 households use taps/pipe water within the premises of their homes while 22.4 percent used taps/pipe water outside of the premises of their homes and 29.8 percent used water from tube well/hand pump. Similarly, the Report states that 1.5 percent of the total 6 million 660 thousand and 841 households used water drawn from covered wells, 3.9 percent used water from spring taps while 4.6 percent used jar and bottle water. It is stated in the report that 2.1 percent of the total 6 million 660 thousand and 841 households use open well water as their main source of water while 0.4 percent used water directly collected from river and streams. In this context, the government has also adopted the Global Sustainable Development Goal 6 to ensure the availability and sustainability management of water and sanitation for all. By 2030, the government aims to increase the number of people using safe drinking water to at least 90%. Similarly, UNICEF's new country programme (2018-2022) in Nepal initiated efforts in WASH programmes to secure enhanced and equitable access to safe and sustainable drinking water, sanitation services, and improved hygiene practices for children and their families. This programme is guided by WASH Sector Development Plan (2016 - 2030). It supports improving water quality through strengthening the water regulatory body, implementing water safety plans, and raising community awareness on household-level water treatment. #drinking water",https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/only-27pc-population-has-access-to-pure-drinking-water,nepal

Related Articles 20 per cent people living below poverty line, Statistics Office says Water birds of 41 species found in Narayani river area Seventy-three per cent of the population is deprived of this facility in lack of minerals including iron in water sources owing to the dilapidated water pipeline and water tank of more than 100 years. Sources of drinking water become more polluted during times of natural disasters like landslide and flood which affects people's health. According to doctors, drinking unfiltered and untreated water due to lack of public awareness has serious impact on public health. Under-Secretary at the Ministry, Madhu Timalsena, said the ministry was working to increase people's access to pure drinking water. Problem has surfaced in distribution of clean drinking water as water sources have become polluted due to distribution of water from pipelines installed some120 years ago, he shared. Timalsena, however, urged people in Kathmandu to drink water supplied by Melamchi drinking water project without any doubt as it is in accordance with standards of the World Health Organisation. He suggested to drinking underground water only after testing it as the iron content in the underground water is generally high. People can suffer from different diseases and infections like diarrhoea, vomiting, jaundice, typhoid and cholera as well as the high risk of hepatitis 'A' and 'E' due to consumption of polluted drinking water, shared doctors. Similarly, infectious disease Specialist Dr Sher Bahadur Pun suggested one and all to drink water only after purifying or boiling it, stating that serious problems might arise in public health due to consumption of contaminated water. ""Back 20 years ago, people used to die suffering from cholera due to drinking polluted water. People are losing their lives due to consumption of polluted water even these days,"" he said, referring to the lack of access to pure drinking water. According to Dr Pun, water is more polluted after monsoon-induced disasters like floods and landslides, and drinking the polluted water will cause water-borne communicable diseases as cholera, diahhroea, hepatitis, dysentery and others. Public health expert Dr Sameer Adhikari warned against using contaminated water in view of the public health. He suggested keeping the water sources clean and drinking boiled water and using clean water to wash fruits and vegetables. Rajendra Aryal, the President of Federation of Drinking Water and Sanitation Users Nepal, said the constitution has made provision that all citizens have the right to potable drinking water as their fundamental right. However, he complained that this fundamental right was not implemented in an effective manner. Aryal called on the government to give priority, in the budget for the upcoming fiscal year 2024/25, to programmes related to access to quality drinking water to all. ""Still many consumers have to line up for hours to collect water, and on top of this, they do not have access to pure water. Programmes for distributing clean drinking water should be moved ahead through collaboration among all the three tiers of the government,"" he emphasized. As per the National Census Report, 2021, 34.6 percent of the total 6 million 660 thousand and 841 households use taps/pipe water within the premises of their homes while 22.4 percent used taps/pipe water outside of the premises of their homes and 29.8 percent used water from tube well/hand pump. Similarly, the Report states that 1.5 percent of the total 6 million 660 thousand and 841 households used water drawn from covered wells, 3.9 percent used water from spring taps while 4.6 percent used jar and bottle water. It is stated in the report that 2.1 percent of the total 6 million 660 thousand and 841 households use open well water as their main source of water while 0.4 percent used water directly collected from river and streams. In this context, the government has also adopted the Global Sustainable Development Goal 6 to ensure the availability and sustainability management of water and sanitation for all. By 2030, the government aims to increase the number of people using safe drinking water to at least 90%. Similarly, UNICEF's new country programme (2018-2022) in Nepal initiated efforts in WASH programmes to secure enhanced and equitable access to safe and sustainable drinking water, sanitation services, and improved hygiene practices for children and their families. This programme is guided by WASH Sector Development Plan (2016 - 2030). It supports improving water quality through strengthening the water regulatory body, implementing water safety plans, and raising community awareness on household-level water treatment. #drinking water",https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/only-27pc-population-has-access-to-pure-drinking-water,nepal

Russia detains suspects in an attack that left at least 115 dead in a Moscow concert hall,By Associated Press,"04:38 pm Mar 23, 2024",Himalayn times,"MOSCOW, MARCH 23 Russian authorities detained 11 people, state media reported Saturday, after gunmen stormed a concert hall in Moscow in a grisly attack that left at least 115 people dead. Related Articles At least 26 dead and 11 missing after flash floods and landslides on Indonesia's Sumatra island Rock band critical of Putin is detained in Thailand, fearful of deportation to Russia Russia's Investigative Committee said four of those detained were directly involved in the attack that left the sprawling shopping mall and music venue smoldering with a collapsed roof. Russian agencies appeared to suggest the attack was linked to Ukraine even though the Islamic State group claimed responsibility in a statement. A U.S. intelligence official told The Associated Press that U.S. agencies had confirmed that that group was responsible for the attack. The four suspects were stopped in the Bryansk region of western Russia, ""not far from the border with Ukraine,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said. They planned to cross the border into Ukraine and ""had contacts"" there, state news agency Tass said, citing Russia's FSB. The head of the FSB briefed President Vladimir Putin on the arrests on Saturday, according to Tass. The attack came just days after Putin cemented his grip on power in a highly orchestrated electoral landslide. The attack was the deadliest in Russia in years and came as the country's fight in Ukraine dragged into a third year. Shortly after the attack, some Russian lawmakers pointed the finger at Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, denied any involvement. ""Ukraine has never resorted to the use of terrorist methods,"" he posted on X, formerly Twitter. ""Everything in this war will be decided only on the battlefield."" Images shared by Russian state media Saturday showed a fleet of emergency vehicles still gathered outside the ruins of Crocus City Hall, which had a capacity of more than 6,000 people in Krasnogorsk, on Moscow's western edge. Videos posted online showed gunmen in the venue shooting civilians at point-blank range. The roof of the theater, where crowds had gathered Friday for a performance by the Russian rock band Picnic, collapsed in the early hours of Saturday morning as firefighters spent hours fighting a fire that erupted during the attack. In a statement posted by its Aamaq news agency, the Islamic State's affiliate in Afghanistan said it had attacked a large gathering of ""Christians"" in Krasnogorsk. It was not immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the claim. A U.S. intelligence official told the AP that U.S. intelligence agencies had gathered information in recent weeks that the IS branch was planning an attack in Moscow, and that U.S. officials had privately shared the intelligence earlier this month with Russian officials. The official was briefed on the matter but was not authorized to publicly discuss the intelligence information and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Messages of outrage, shock and support for those affected have since streamed in from around the world. On Friday, the U.N. Security Council condemned ""the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack"" and underlined the need for the perpetrators to be held accountable. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the terrorist attack ""in the strongest possible terms,"" his spokesman said. Meanwhile, in Moscow itself, hundreds of people stood in line Saturday morning to donate blood and plasma, Russia's health ministry said. Putin, who extended his grip on Russia for another six years in this week's presidential vote after a sweeping crackdown on dissent, had publicly denounced the Western warnings of a potential terrorist attack as an attempt to intimidate Russians. ""All that resembles open blackmail and an attempt to frighten and destabilize our society,"" he said earlier this week. In October 2015, a bomb planted by the Islamic State downed a Russian passenger plane over Sinai, killing all 224 people on board, most of them Russian vacation-goers returning from Egypt. The group, which operates mainly in Syria and Iraq but also in Afghanistan and Africa, also has claimed several attacks in Russia's volatile Caucasus and other regions in the past years. It recruited fighters from Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. #Moscow terrorist attack #concert hall",https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/russia-detains-suspects-in-an-attack-that-left-at-least-115-dead-in-a-moscow-concert-hall,world

"Russia attacks Ukrainian electrical power facilities, including major hydroelectric plant",By Associated Press,"03:27 pm Mar 22, 2024",Himalayn times,"KYIV, MARCH 22 Russia attacked electrical power facilities in much of Ukraine, including the country's largest hydroelectric plant, causing widespread outages and killing at least three people, officials said Friday. Related Articles Putin is set to win 6 more years in power. Here's how it will affect the war and Russia's relations Ukrainian troops pull back again as Russia's onslaught pushes ahead in eastern Ukraine Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system."" The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation. The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said. The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident. The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed. One person was killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional governor Ivan Fedorov. Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry. ""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app. Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border. The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit. Both regions have been subject to shelling and drone attacks in recent weeks and officials have said that attempts by Ukrainian fighters to cross into Russian territory have been repelled. #Russia-Ukraine war",https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/russia-attacks-ukrainian-electrical-power-facilities-including-major-hydroelectric-plant,world

New Delhi's top elected official arrested in liquor bribery case,By Associated Press,"10:57 pm Mar 21, 2024",Himalayn times,"NEW DELHI, MARCH 21 India's anti-corruption crusader Arvind Kejriwal was arrested Thursday by a federal agency that accused his party and ministers of accepting 1 billion rupees ($12 million) in bribes from liquor contractors nearly two years ago, a top leader of his party said. Related Articles Thousands of Indian farmers protest in New Delhi demanding a law guaranteeing minimum crop prices College proprietor Gurung arrested on gold smuggling case Atishi Singh, a leader of Kejriwal's Aaam Admi Party, or Common People's Party, denied the accusations and said they were fabricated by the federal agency, which is controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's government. Singh said her party will ask India's Supreme Court to quash Kejriwal's arrest and that he should be questioned, not arrested, as the investigation is still in progress in the case. He will continue to be Delhi's chief minister while the party fights the accusations, she said. Footage from local TV showed police whisking away Kejriwal's supporters in buses as federal agents arrested him after questioning him for hours at his residence in New Delhi. One of the charges under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is that 14 wholesale liquor distributors earned an ""excess profit"" of 3.38 billion rupees ($41 million) when the now-scrapped liquor policy was in operation two years ago. The arrest came hours after Delhi's High Court refused to grant any protection to Kejriwal, 55, over the summons issued to him by the Enforcement Directorate, a federal agency that probes economic offenses, in connection with the alleged scam. The federal agency had called Kejriwal for questioning nine times in recent months, according to a government lawyer. But Kejriwal skipped the summons each time saying he was busy with his political work. Kejriwal's lawyer, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, told the court Thursday that the probe agency was being misused by the Modi government to weaken his party ahead of India's national elections to be held in April-May. Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has been defeated in Delhi state elections by Kejriwal's party and also was defeated in northern Punjab state in 2022. The federal agency accused Kejriwal's government of a sudden increase in the wholesaler dealers' profit margin under the excise policy to 12% from 5%. Government attorney S.V. Raju said that 14 wholesale liquor distributors earned ""excess profit"" of 3.38 billion rupees ($41.2 million) in less than a year and in turn paid 1 billion rupees ($12.1 million) in bribes to Kejriwal's party and other ministers.

New Delhi's top elected official arrested in liquor bribery case,By Associated Press,"10:57 pm Mar 21, 2024",Himalayn times,"NEW DELHI, MARCH 21 India's anti-corruption crusader Arvind Kejriwal was arrested Thursday by a federal agency that accused his party and ministers of accepting 1 billion rupees ($12 million) in bribes from liquor contractors nearly two years ago, a top leader of his party said. Related Articles Thousands of Indian farmers protest in New Delhi demanding a law guaranteeing minimum crop prices College proprietor Gurung arrested on gold smuggling case Atishi Singh, a leader of Kejriwal's Aaam Admi Party, or Common People's Party, denied the accusations and said they were fabricated by the federal agency, which is controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's government. Singh said her party will ask India's Supreme Court to quash Kejriwal's arrest and that he should be questioned, not arrested, as the investigation is still in progress in the case. He will continue to be Delhi's chief minister while the party fights the accusations, she said. Footage from local TV showed police whisking away Kejriwal's supporters in buses as federal agents arrested him after questioning him for hours at his residence in New Delhi. One of the charges under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is that 14 wholesale liquor distributors earned an ""excess profit"" of 3.38 billion rupees ($41 million) when the now-scrapped liquor policy was in operation two years ago. The arrest came hours after Delhi's High Court refused to grant any protection to Kejriwal, 55, over the summons issued to him by the Enforcement Directorate, a federal agency that probes economic offenses, in connection with the alleged scam. The federal agency had called Kejriwal for questioning nine times in recent months, according to a government lawyer. But Kejriwal skipped the summons each time saying he was busy with his political work. Kejriwal's lawyer, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, told the court Thursday that the probe agency was being misused by the Modi government to weaken his party ahead of India's national elections to be held in April-May. Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has been defeated in Delhi state elections by Kejriwal's party and also was defeated in northern Punjab state in 2022.

Anticipation and anger on Texas border as strict immigration law again on hold,By Associated Press,"10:22 pm Mar 20, 2024",Himalayn times,"TEXAS, MARCH 20 A federal appeals court late Tuesday again prevented Texas from arresting and deporting migrants accused of entering the US illegally, hours after the the law briefly took effect. Related Articles Meta Platforms must face advertisers' class action, US appeals court says In Senegal's capital, Nicaragua is a hot ticket among travel agents as migrants try to reach US Before a divided US Supreme Court earlier let the state law take effect while a legal challenge plays out, some sheriffs were ready to relish an unprecedented state expansion into border enforcement, while others were reluctant. Texas was silent in the hours after the ruling on whether and when state troopers or Texas National Guard soldiers - who have the most interaction with migrants -- would begin enforcement. Hours later, an order by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals put the law again on hold. By a 2-1 order, a panel of the appeals court lifted that pause ahead of arguments before the court on Wednesday. Mexico's Foreign Affairs Secretary said in a sharply worded statement that it would refuse to take anyone back who is ordered to leave the country under the state law and that it ""categorically rejects"" any state or local government enforcement of immigration laws. ""Mexico reiterates the legitimate right to protect the rights of its nationals in the United States and to determine its own policies regarding entry into its territory,"" the government said. Kinney County Sheriff Brad Coe, who has largely embraced Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's multibillion-dollar border enforcement effort, said he was ""prepared to proceed with prosecutions"" but officers would need ""probable cause"" to make arrests. His county covers a stretch of border near Del Rio that was recently the busiest corridor for illegal crossings but quieted considerably. ""It is unlikely that observers will see an overnight change,"" Coe said. El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, the top county executive, said immigration enforcement should remain a federal, not state, responsibility, echoing the Biden administration's view. He said heightened law enforcement presence in the city of El Paso during a previous migrant surge brought high-speed chases and traffic stops based on assumptions that passengers were in the counry illegally. ""We had accidents, we had injuries, we got a little glimpse of what would happen if the state begins to control what happens in respect to immigration,"" Samaniego said. The impact extends far beyond the Texas border. Republican legislators wrote the law so that it applies in all of the state's 254 counties, although Steve McCraw, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, has said he expects it will mostly be enforced near the border. Other GOP-states far from the border are also already looking to follow Texas' path. In Iowa, the state House on Tuesday gave final approval to a bill that would also give its state law enforcement the power to arrest people who are in the U.S. illegally and have previously been denied entry into the country. It now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. If signed, it would take effect in July. ""The federal government has abdicated its responsibilities and states can and must act,"" said Rep. Steven Holt, a Republican from Denison. Skylor Hearn, executive director of the Sheriffs' Association of Texas, said sheriffs' offices have been training since last year. ""If a county chooses to take it on themselves, they are choosing for their taxpayers to take it on themselves as well,"" Hearn said. ""As long as the federal government is willing to do its part that it is supposed to be doing, it is ideal for them to take possession and custody of these people."" There was no immediate rush on the border and no word of arrests, but news of the ruling spread rapidly and triggered alarm among migrant advocates. ""Terrible, late-breaking news, my friends!"" Carlos Eduardo Espina said on his TikTok account with more than 8 million followers, many of them migrants in transit. He said the law would sow confusion and promised ""know-your-rights"" instructions on how to respond to police questioning. Daniel Morales, an associate professor of law at the University of Houston Law Center, said the Texas law ""will be a mess, very clearly, to enforce."" ""It's very clear that Greg Abbott wants to enforce the law so he can get lots of photo ops and opportunities, but it's gonna take a lot of state resources to implement. And I don't know, in fact, how much appetite and capacity for that the state government actually has,"" Morales said. Texas will find enforcement is ""difficult and taxing,"" he said. Arrests for illegal crossings fell by half in January from a record-high of 250,000 in December, with sharp declines in Texas. Arrests in the Border Patrol's Del Rio sector, the focus of Abbott's enforcement, fell 76% from December. Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings for much of the last decade, recorded its fewest arrests since June 2020. Tucson, Arizona, has been the busiest corridor in recent months, followed by San Diego in January, but reasons for sudden shifts are often complicated and are dictated by smuggling organizations. When President Joe Biden visited the Rio Grande Valley for his second trip to the border as president last month, administration officials credited Mexico for heightened enforcement on that part of the border for the drop in arrests. They said conditions were more challenging for Mexican law enforcement in Sonora, the state that lies south of Arizona. #US Immigration Law",https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/anticipation-and-anger-on-texas-border-as-strict-immigration-law-again-on-hold,world

Some of nearly 300 abducted schoolchildren in Nigeria's north are freed after weeks in captivity,By Associated Press,"05:22 pm Mar 24, 2024",Himalayn times,"ABUJA, MARCH 24 At least 137 of nearly 300 Nigerian children abducted more than two weeks ago from their school in the northwestern state of Kaduna were released on Sunday, the West African nation's military said. Related Articles More than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel-Hamas war, Gaza Health Ministry says First US lunar lander in more than 50 years launched but develops problem on way to moon An earlier statement from the government suggested that all the students were freed. Motorcycle-riding gunmen invaded the Kuriga school on March 7 and marched the children into the forests before security forces could arrive, as terrified families watched helplessly. School authorities said a total of 287 students were kidnapped during the attack, at least 100 of them are aged 12 or younger. At least 1,400 students have been kidnapped from Nigerian schools since 2014, when Boko Haram militants seized hundreds of schoolgirls from Borno state's Chibok village. In recent years, abductions have been concentrated in the country's northwestern and central regions, where dozens of armed groups often target villagers and travelers for ransom. The 137 children were rescued in Zamfara state, an enclave known for kidnappings more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) away from their school, Nigerian military spokesman Maj. Gen. Edward Buba said in a statement. ""Efforts would continue until other hostages are found and the terrorists arrested, tried, and brought to justice by Nigerian law,"" Buba said. At least 17 other schoolchildren in northern Sokoto state were also rescued two weeks after they were taken hostage, according to a statement issued Saturday by the Sokoto state government. Kaduna state Gov. Uba Sani, who first announced the rescue, did not give details about the operation. His office could not be reached Sunday to clarify the discrepancy in the number of those freed. The Associated Press could not reach villagers in Kuriga town, where mobile network is not available. Under growing pressure to end the mass kidnappings in northern Nigeria, President Bola Tinubu promised his administration is ""deploying detailed strategies to ensure that our schools remain safe sanctuaries of learning, not lairs for wanton abductions."" Tinubu had vowed to rescue the children ""without paying a dime"" as ransom. But ransoms are commonly paid for kidnappings, often arranged by families, and it is rare for officials in Nigeria to admit to the payments. No group has claimed responsibility for the Kaduna kidnapping, which locals have blamed on bandit groups known for mass killings and kidnappings for ransom in the conflict-battered northern region, most of them former herders in conflict with settled communities. At least two people with extensive knowledge of the security crisis in Nigeria's northwest told AP that the identity of the abductors is known. Murtala Ahmed Rufa'i, a professor of peace and conflict studies at Usmanu Danfodiyo University, and Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, a cleric who has negotiated with the bandits, said they were hiding in the region's vast and ungoverned forests. Arrests are rare in Nigeria's mass kidnappings, as victims are usually released only after desperate families pay ransoms or through deals with government and security officials. #Nigeria school kidnapping",https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/some-of-nearly-300-abducted-schoolchildren-in-nigerias-north-are-freed-after-weeks-in-captivity,world

Spiritual excavation of intangible heritages: Just as important as tangible ones,By Ram Achal Yadav,"12:31 pm Mar 24, 2024",Himalayn times,"As both the treasures, tangible and intangible ones, play a crucial role towards enriching our cultural legacy that advances human capital, cultivating peace and harmony from within, these intangible heritages cherishing immense spiritual values deep within also need to be discovered, harvested, presented, preserved and promoted like the tangible heritages. Time has thus come for the spiritual excavation and exploration to discover the vast intangibly tangible cultural as well as spiritual heritage and harvest its very essence that went into oblivion down the centuries after the sack of Kapilavastu Kapilavastu of Ancient Shakya Kingdom cherishes beneath it not only the tangible archaeological remains but also a vast intangibly tangible cultural and spiritual treasure. With its sack that resulted in the massacre of a great number of Shakyas, ""Kapilavastu"" gradually disappeared from the world's physical map, and its legacy went into oblivion in the history down the ages. The search for ""Kapilavastu"", the lost capital city of ancient Shakya Kingdom, began from the first millennia CE. In this course, as a part of their pilgrimage, prominent Chinese pilgrims Faxian and Zuanzang visited ancient Kapilavastu in the 5th and 7th CE, respectively and mentioned in their travelogue the details regarding the whereabouts and locations of ""Kapilavastu "" as well as distances from one heritage to another along with other socio-economic, cultural and geographical features.

As soon as the news spread about the discovery of the lost ancient capital city of Kapilavastu, people from around the world started visiting ""Tilaurakot-Kapilavastu"" as well as other important archaeological and cultural heritage sites of the ancient Shakya Kingdom.

As a result of a series of scientific investigations and excavations carried out by different teams of technical experts at different periods and time frame representing the Archaeological Survey of India, Risho University, Japan, ISMEO, Italy and Durham University, UK in collaboration with the Department of Archaeology, Lumbini Development Trust, Government of Nepal, ample evidence was discovered that helped the Government of Nepal to submit the final nomination dossier to UNESCO in order for ""Tilaurakot"" to be granted world heritage status. Thus, efforts towards discovering tangible archaeological heritages in Kapilavastu have been noticeably successful though there is still much left to be done with regard to excavating, identifying, presenting, preserving and promoting most of out of over 136 archaeological as well as cultural heritage sites situated throughout Kapilavastu district itself that makes the district an open museum.

The quest for calm: When information is far too surplus,By Rajgopal Nidamboor,"10:09 am Mar 21, 2024",Himalayn times,"The search for calm is similar to our endless search for happiness. We all have it in us. If calmness is a reward for living a peaceful life, so is happiness - a veritable canvas that spreads optimism. When you learn to find them in the present-moment, you'll attain quietude and also a sense of personal stillness It is a paraphernalia of the routine. It is also clockwork. From the time we get up in the morning until the time we go to bed each night, we are like a parched mop. We are constantly taking in just too much information than required, thanks to the glut of information out there. Sixty-five per cent of our information, for the most part, is absorbed by our eyes and brain; 25 per cent from sound; and, the residual 10 per cent from flavour, feeling and smell. Our mind is flooded, just as much, during wakeful hours, with sensory information. The flow is so enormous that we can't think clearly at times. Call it our 'sensory overload' - yet, the best part is just 'too' much information and nerve-racking multi-tasking patterns present themselves as our ego's best billboard. The outcome is mental fatigue, or burnout - a term customarily used for top-notch tennis players. It is paradoxical that enough is not enough for our information surplus, which is a part of our frenzied pace of change, where you are living your life, or career, at excess speed. You have only two options - fasten your seat belt and ride the information shuttle at the speed of thought, or walk out of such entrapped sensory stimuli to give your mind a well-deserved rest. It is a thin dividing line, indeed - from hectic activity to balance and inner peace. While most corporates pontificate that you ought to maintain work-life balance, they do not often encourage us to do so. The irony also is, most of us are not conscious that we have a choice - although some of us know that we should 'unplug' ourselves from the outside world and calm the turbulence in our mind, while reconnecting with our deepest self that is 'begging' us for conscious attention. Related Articles 50,000 fine for giving false information for citizenship in Ilam 20 per cent people living below poverty line, Statistics Office says Despite ground-breaking advances in science and technology, a dividing wall continues to confront philosophers and mind researchers about the foundations of our active mind and functioning brain. Most mind scientists articulate the view that the mind is more than a corollary of brain functioning, what with a multitude of neurochemicals responsible for each thought and feeling - albeit new advances in consciousness suggest that the mind and consciousness are independent of the brain. While we all agree that the brain is our key organ of reference, new developments in brain research suggest that every cell in your body has its own sense of conscious awareness. This is the reason why all of us concur that surplus sensory stimulation can lead to sloppy focus, mental exhaustion, abridged decision making, warped communication skills and, possibly, hyperactivity in children, while triggering a stressful state. The only way you'd help balance your mind, body and soul is by taking regular pauses, like moving away from your desk, and preventing mental fatigue, reduced productivity, or creativity. You'd do well to think of your mind as a TV signal, with each of your five senses functioning like specific TV channels on the remote. What does this signify? That too much of TV viewing can lead to mental inertia like excess information. This can twist your thinking abilities, while affecting your best intentions, thoughts and behaviour. The best way to seek a balance between this frantic state and the serene world of inner peace is to enter stillness every day and allow serenity to fill your mind. This can be achieved by setting aside a little time each day - and, disengaging from our 'automated' world. In other words, you'd turn off your TV, cell phone and computer, for a while, each day. This is not a mindboggling act, but 'mindful awakening.' You are composed when you appreciate yourself as a caringly evolved being. The reason is simple. When you understand yourself and others, you also cultivate the power to value everyone's sensibilities; also, sensitivities. You'll recognise clearly the interconnectedness of things - their actions, cause and also effect. You'll not grumble, erupt, fuss, or deplore. When you are calm, you will govern yourself - you will also be in control. You'll know how to adapt, adjust and revere your spiritual calling. You will connect with the divine and feel that you can learn from all things, big and small. The calmer you are, the greater your success, influence and acceptance. Your sense of equanimity is what makes people to like and respect you; they will also prefer to transact with you, because they find your behaviour affable. A calm person is like a shade-giving tree, an umbrella-like canopy during monsoon. You'd call this quietude too - the first lesson of civilisation, the blooming of the soul. It's as precious as wisdom and, perhaps, much more valuable than gold. A life of calm is much better than all the riches in the world - because it brings to you a life that resides in the nest of truth, underneath the calm waves, beyond the reach of thunder, and in perpetual serenity. The search for calm is similar to our endless search for happiness. We all have it in us - not outside of us. If calmness is a reward for living a peaceful life, so is happiness - a veritable canvas that spreads optimism. Calmness and happiness reflect our future; also, purpose. When you learn to find them in the present-moment, you'll attain quietude and also a sense of personal stillness. Humanity is at loggerheads with itself, today. Witness - unrestrained fury, bigotry, profanity, hate, or angst. You need to be a sage, if your thoughts are controlled and purified. You ought to be an ascetic to lure the tempests of your soul to obey your thoughts. Or, so you would think. This is erroneous. Each of us can bring tranquillity into our life in little ways, because tiny nuggets of wisdom quieten our turbulent minds - more so, when we are uneasy, jittery, or frantic.

The quest for calm: When information is far too surplus,By Rajgopal Nidamboor,"10:09 am Mar 21, 2024",Himalayn times,"The search for calm is similar to our endless search for happiness. We all have it in us. If calmness is a reward for living a peaceful life, so is happiness - a veritable canvas that spreads optimism. When you learn to find them in the present-moment, you'll attain quietude and also a sense of personal stillness It is a paraphernalia of the routine. It is also clockwork. From the time we get up in the morning until the time we go to bed each night, we are like a parched mop. We are constantly taking in just too much information than required, thanks to the glut of information out there. Sixty-five per cent of our information, for the most part, is absorbed by our eyes and brain; 25 per cent from sound; and, the residual 10 per cent from flavour, feeling and smell. Our mind is flooded, just as much, during wakeful hours, with sensory information. The flow is so enormous that we can't think clearly at times. Call it our 'sensory overload' - yet, the best part is just 'too' much information and nerve-racking multi-tasking patterns present themselves as our ego's best billboard. The outcome is mental fatigue, or burnout - a term customarily used for top-notch tennis players. It is paradoxical that enough is not enough for our information surplus, which is a part of our frenzied pace of change, where you are living your life, or career, at excess speed. You have only two options - fasten your seat belt and ride the information shuttle at the speed of thought, or walk out of such entrapped sensory stimuli to give your mind a well-deserved rest. It is a thin dividing line, indeed - from hectic activity to balance and inner peace. While most corporates pontificate that you ought to maintain work-life balance, they do not often encourage us to do so. The irony also is, most of us are not conscious that we have a choice - although some of us know that we should 'unplug' ourselves from the outside world and calm the turbulence in our mind, while reconnecting with our deepest self that is 'begging' us for conscious attention. Related Articles 50,000 fine for giving false information for citizenship in Ilam 20 per cent people living below poverty line, Statistics Office says Despite ground-breaking advances in science and technology, a dividing wall continues to confront philosophers and mind researchers about the foundations of our active mind and functioning brain. Most mind scientists articulate the view that the mind is more than a corollary of brain functioning, what with a multitude of neurochemicals responsible for each thought and feeling - albeit new advances in consciousness suggest that the mind and consciousness are independent of the brain. While we all agree that the brain is our key organ of reference, new developments in brain research suggest that every cell in your body has its own sense of conscious awareness. This is the reason why all of us concur that surplus sensory stimulation can lead to sloppy focus, mental exhaustion, abridged decision making, warped communication skills and, possibly, hyperactivity in children, while triggering a stressful state. The only way you'd help balance your mind, body and soul is by taking regular pauses, like moving away from your desk, and preventing mental fatigue, reduced productivity, or creativity. You'd do well to think of your mind as a TV signal, with each of your five senses functioning like specific TV channels on the remote. What does this signify? That too much of TV viewing can lead to mental inertia like excess information. This can twist your thinking abilities, while affecting your best intentions, thoughts and behaviour. The best way to seek a balance between this frantic state and the serene world of inner peace is to enter stillness every day and allow serenity to fill your mind. This can be achieved by setting aside a little time each day - and, disengaging from our 'automated' world. In other words, you'd turn off your TV, cell phone and computer, for a while, each day. This is not a mindboggling act, but 'mindful awakening.' You are composed when you appreciate yourself as a caringly evolved being. The reason is simple. When you understand yourself and others, you also cultivate the power to value everyone's sensibilities; also, sensitivities. You'll recognise clearly the interconnectedness of things - their actions, cause and also effect. You'll not grumble, erupt, fuss, or deplore. When you are calm, you will govern yourself - you will also be in control. You'll know how to adapt, adjust and revere your spiritual calling. You will connect with the divine and feel that you can learn from all things, big and small. The calmer you are, the greater your success, influence and acceptance. Your sense of equanimity is what makes people to like and respect you; they will also prefer to transact with you, because they find your behaviour affable. A calm person is like a shade-giving tree, an umbrella-like canopy during monsoon. You'd call this quietude too - the first lesson of civilisation, the blooming of the soul. It's as precious as wisdom and, perhaps, much more valuable than gold. A life of calm is much better than all the riches in the world - because it brings to you a life that resides in the nest of truth, underneath the calm waves, beyond the reach of thunder, and in perpetual serenity. The search for calm is similar to our endless search for happiness. We all have it in us - not outside of us.

Bleak impact of ODA on Nepal's education sector: Rigorous evaluation of funding proposals is called for,By Lok Bhattarai,"10:09 am Mar 21, 2024",Himalayn times,"Enhanced quality in higher education could enable individuals to earn higher incomes abroad, encourage a surge in startups domestically, and position the country as a hub for international education Over the past decade, the Government of Nepal has received significant Official Development Assistance (ODA) amounting upto US$ 1 billion for educational development. However, there is growing concern about the lack of expected outcomes and measurable results of this investment. Although the major accountable stakeholder is the government itself, development partners seem less concerned in evaluating the real impact of their assistance, raising questions about accountability and the effectiveness of aid in this sector. Despite some irregularities highlighted by the Auditor General in its annual reports, other major stakeholders in this space such as the National Planning Commission (NPC), Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Education and development partners (DP) like the World Bank and ADB apparently are simply concerned about keeping the 'ball rolling'. Deficiencies surfaced in almost all areas, such as learners' progress, labour market integration, economic growth and overall public experience. Related Articles We could see the world's 1st trillionaire in the next decade. Here are some of today's richest 1% India's opposition lawmakers protest their suspension from Parliament by the government The dismal impact of investments in this sector prompts critical questions on weightage of various factors. While factors like ineffective policies, faulty priorities and flawed programme design and implementation are significant contributors, the role of irregularities and corruption cannot be overlooked. A significant portion of Nepal's urban and peri-urban population might be unaware of the substantial aid money allocated to educational reform. This is because many families in these areas opt to send their children to private schools, bearing the entire cost themselves. A paradox exists where significant aid money aims at enhancing public education, yet everyday experiences reflect frustration. Textbooks take up to six months to reach remote areas, and public schools in many districts witness alarming dropout rates. Policy for lenient evaluation method for grade progression signals hidden troubles underneath. The government's recent provision of model questions for the school-leaving exams indicates a lack of confidence in the educational authority. A concerning trend has emerged as many students in Nepal appear to endure school until their 18th birthday, aiming to obtain passports and migrate abroad. Recent large-scale teacher protests also underscore significant underlying issues within the education sector. Moreover, the persistence of child marriage, rape cases and suicides among students manly in the rural areas highlights grave failures in the country's education system. A circular dynamic emerges as low-quality public education drives unskilled labour migration, leading to family breakdowns. This, in turn, exacerbates child poverty, compelling children to attend poor-quality public schools, perpetuating the cycle of educational and socio-economic disadvantage in the next generation. A significant portion of allocated funds for education reform has been directed towards higher education. Tribhuvan University, the largest stakeholder in higher education, faces numerous challenges, including politicisation, excessive delays in examination administration, mismanagement and a lack of innovation. Furthermore, issues persist in the quality standards of teaching and research, inadequate linkages to labour market needs, and an environment unsupportive of innovation. Without addressing these issues and enhancing the quality of higher education, the country cannot realise its full economic potential and drive innovation. A robust ecosystem of quality higher education is pivotal for a country's economic development. Enhanced quality in higher education holds the promise of transforming a nation in multiple ways. It could enable individuals to earn higher incomes abroad, encourage a surge in startups domestically, and position the country as a hub for international education. Situated amidst densely populated regions, Nepal's pleasant climate and relatively lower living-cost offer ideal conditions to be an international educational hub. The Ministry of Education shoulders a substantial responsibility for the discussed underperformance and mass failure in the education sector. A notable shift towards local authorities has occurred for the school education, yet neither the central ministry nor the local authorities possess the requisite organisational structure, planning capabilities, or expertise to ensure the effective delivery of quality education. This structural deficiency at both levels hampers this sector's ability to meet the educational needs and aspirations of the population, demanding a revaluation of organisational frameworks and capabilities. To address these issues at the school level, several measures can be recommended. Firstly, there should be a rigorous evaluation of funding proposals received by development partners to ensure optimal impact of resources. Policy and programme planning must be objectively tied up with desired outcomes and be responsive to changing social and locational realities. Moreover, heads of education in local authorities should possess a blend of policy, administrative and teaching expertise rather than solely being civil servants. Result-oriented teacher training programmes and timely updates in curriculum are also essential. Indeed, for higher education, prioritising research, fostering strong industry-academia partnerships, updating curricula to reflect current needs, and linking teaching and research to innovation and entrepreneurship are crucial steps. Introducing new, timely courses can further enhance the quality of education, offering hope and optimism for the Nepali society by equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed for success in today's dynamic global landscape. These measures can contribute significantly to uplifting the higher education sector and fostering a culture of innovation and progress in Nepal.

Leaders should create mentorship and sponsorship programmes to help women navigate the corporate jungle and crack the glass ceiling.These programmes build the organization's female leadership pipeline. Do you ensure a strong representation of women in redressal committees? Senior and sufficient women in any organizational redressal committee are essential for fair and successful workplace issue resolution. They are not just a matter of tokenism but a strategic need for workplace respect and accountability. Are You Leading by Example in Creating an Inclusive Workplace or Ignoring Discrimination? An inclusive workplace requires leadership accountability.Diversity indicators should be included in performance evaluations for organizational leaders to promote team diversity and inclusion. We should demand actual action from our leaders on International Women's Day instead of celebrating meaningless gestures.All leaders, put your money where your mouth is.Women deserve action, not words. Stop sending flower emojis and start reporting your behaviours!

Kohli versus Dhoni as IPL begins with a clash of two of India's greatest cricketers,By Associated Press,"11:07 pm Mar 21, 2024",Himalayn times,"NEW DELHI, MARCH 21 Virat Kohli against MS Dhoni. For the lucrative Indian Premier League and its billion-plus audience, the head-to-head encounter is a perfect prime time opener for the eight-week season. Related Articles Police use tear gas against Indian farmers marching to New Delhi to demand guaranteed crop prices Premier League title race gets a lot tighter as Arsenal beats Liverpool 3-1 after Alisson's errors Kohli and Royal Challengers Bengaluru go to Chennai on Friday to face Dhoni and the defending champion Super Kings. Kohli returns to action after missing international cricket for nearly two months - he skipped India's test series win over England owing to the birth of his second child. Dhoni returns from 10 months out. He surprised on Thursday when he gave up the Chennai captaincy he's mainly held since the league started in 2008. Ruturaj Gaikwad has the armband. Dhoni previously wasn't captain briefly in 2022, but was restored and continued in 2023 when he led Chennai to a record-equaling fifth IPL title. He announced then his intention to retire at the end of this season. ""He (Dhoni) is the greatest ever captain, and I am very lucky that I have spent some time with him over the years,"" Bengaluru skipper Faf du Plessis told broadcaster Star Sports. ""That's probably the biggest thing in my career, my years at Chennai. It shaped me from a leadership perspective, just observing MS. As a young leader, it was special to my growth."" Three-time runner-up Bengaluru has never won the IPL but its women's team ended the franchise's trophy drought by winning the Women's IPL last Sunday. Meanwhile, India captain Rohit Sharma has made way for a new skipper at Mumbai Indians. Allrounder Hardik Pandya was brought in through a high-profile player trade with Gujarat Titans in November. Pandya, who played for five-time champion Mumbai from 2015-21, signed with Gujarat ahead of the 2022 IPL. He captained the new franchise to a maiden title that season and they finished runner-up to Chennai in 2023. Mumbai won all five of its titles under Sharma, the last in 2020. A barren three-year run prompted a first regime change after 11 years, which has sparked backlash among the Mumbai fan base. ""This team has achieved all of its glory under him (Rohit), so it won't be any different because he will always be there to help me out if I need his help,"" Pandya told a news conference. ""From now on, it will just be me carrying forward what he has started."" Shubman Gill has the captaincy at Gujarat Titans in his first major leadership stint. Meanwhile, wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been declared fit for cricket at the highest level. Pant has recovered from knee and back injuries since being in a car accident in December 2022. He will lead the Delhi Capitals again, having previously led them to the 2020 final. Yashasvi Jaiswal, who scored 712 runs against England in the recent five-test series, will pair at the top with England's Jos Buttler for Rajasthan Royals. Australia pace duo Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins became the two most expensive IPL players during the auction in December. Starc returns to the IPL for the first time since 2015, when he played for Bengaluru. Kolkata Knight Riders have paid Starc about $3 million for his services. Sunrisers Hyderabad shelled out nearly $2.5 million for Cummins, who will lead the team. #Indian Premier League #Virat Kohli #Mahendra Singh Dhoni",https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/kohli-versus-dhoni-as-ipl-begins-with-a-clash-of-two-of-indias-greatest-cricketers,sports

"Final preparations underway for Fourth Manjushree Trail Race, set to commence on April 5",By THT Online,"02:42 pm Mar 21, 2024",Himalayn times,"KATHMANDU, MARCH 21 Preparations for the ""Fourth Manjushree Trail Race,"" set to begin on April 5, have reached their final stages. The organizers held a press conference on Tuesday to announce that the race's setup is nearly complete. During the press conference, race president Subash Thapa revealed that this year's race would continue the tradition of the past events. He mentioned that 270 runners from 16 countries, including Nepal, have registered for this edition. Among these, 232 are from Nepal. Thapa also said that an additional 50 to 100 athletes are expected to participate through international organizations like Asia Trail Masters, stating, ""The registration deadline is April 1. We anticipate many more runners will join by then."" This year's race has been designated as a selection event following an agreement with Asia Trail Masters. Asia Trail Masters is an internationally recognized series of trail races in Asia, organized by Kuai Sports Promotions Limited in Hong Kong. It is also an annual championship featuring a transparent and straightforward points system. Furthermore, the Grandmaster Quest offers equal opportunities to runners across all categories. According to the organizers, the season concludes with an ""ATM Final,"" where the ultimate winner is crowned. Now in its eighth year, the series will include 30 races across 12 to 15 Asian countries, with key events in Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. The third Manjushree Trail Race in 2023 saw 88 participants, including 67 Nepali nationals and 21 foreigners. The Manjushree Trail Race, known for being the longest in Nepal, covers seven major peaks around Kathmandu Valley-Jamacho, Shivpuri, Nagarkot, Phulchowki, Champadevi, Bhasmasur, and Chandragiri. Runners will ascend a total of 12,695 meters over a distance of 100 miles. The race is inspired by the legend of Manjushree, a monk who is said to have visited the hills surrounding Kathmandu to drain a pond, forming the valley. Marked in white and yellow, the trail is popular for hiking and cycling, guiding runners through forests, rivers, fields, and villages. Approximately 70 percent of the course is off-road.

Thapa also mentioned that a 10 km race will begin from Kalupande Hill on April 6, ending in Single Tree, Ichangunarayan. To support the runners, 19 checkpoints will offer food, water, and basic medical supplies. Accommodations for rest are arranged at three locations. Emergency services, including medical teams and ambulances, are coordinated with local hospitals, Thapa added. The route, first envisioned by renowned runners Lizzie Hawker, Seth Olpin, and Roger Henken in 2015, was initially established in 2016. Jimmy Ostrom, Raj Pradhan, Narayan Acharya, and others have since refined it, with recent efforts from Trailmandu and the Manjushree Trail Races institutionalizing improvements, markings, and GPS tracking. Finalizing the 170 km route involved multiple stages and took about three years. Thapa also announced a special 2 km race on April 6 to support social inclusion, featuring events for differently-able boys and girls, in partnership with the Nepal Down Syndrome Society. Twenty participants are expected in this race. Narayan Acharya, Vice President of Manjushree Trail Race, shared that this kind of adventure race offers a sense of meditation. Reflecting on the past, he mentioned, ""Races were held around 2012, but they were not as long. This kind of race started only later."" He highlighted that the 100-mile Manjushree Trail Race represents a significant endeavor towards long-distance running. Acharya also emphasized the cultural immersion aspect of the race. ""It's a race that spans different districts, weaving through Tamang, Newari, and hilly settlements. It offers a unique opportunity to experience diverse cultures and connect with nature,"" he explained. According to him, participants in this race have also achieved commendable results in international competitions. President Thapa said that the Manjushree Trail Race will be viewed with special importance at the international level as is internationally recognized, being affiliated with the International Trail Running Association (ITRA) and Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB), which sets global standards for trail running. ""Completing the 'Manjushree Trail Race' according to ITRA criteria awards participants with six ITRA points, meeting the minimum qualifications for international trail races,"" he said. Winners of the 170 km race will receive cash prizes of Rs 60,000, Rs 40,000, and Rs 20,000 for first, second, and third places, respectively. In the 100 km category, the prizes are Rs 40,000, Rs 25,000, and Rs 15,000, and for the 50 km race, Rs 30,000, Rs 15,000, and Rs 10,000. Similarly, the KVR 100 stage race winners will receive Rs 20,000, Rs 10,000, and Rs 5,000 along with medals and certificates.

"Japanese animation studio founder Miyazaki isn't ready to retire just yet, after latest Oscar win",By Associated Press,"12:22 pm Mar 12, 2024",Himalayn times,"TOKYO, MARCH 12 Ghibli, the Japanese studio that just won its second Oscar for feature animation for ""The Boy and The Heron,"" hasn't said yet what it plans next. But founder Hayao Miyazaki, who at 83 was the oldest director ever nominated in that category, won't rule out making another film, even if his next project is a short instead of a full-length feature. Miyazaki, according to a longtime confidante, is a bit embarrassed about having pronounced a decade ago that he would no longer make movies, citing his age. ""He regrets having announced to the world he won't make another film,"" producer Toshio Suzuki, the co-founder of Studio Ghibli, said after the latest win. When the Oscar was announced early Monday in Japan, a cheer went up in the tiny, humble building that houses the studio on the fringes of sprawling Tokyo where dozens of invited media had crammed in to watch the ceremony on a big screen. It was a big day for Japanese filmmaking, with ""Godzilla Minus One"" winning the award for best visual effects, marking Japan's first win in that category. Japanese media heaped praise on both the Ghibli and Godzilla films, noting that a double win at the Oscars hadn't happened for the country since 2009. An editorial Tuesday in the mass-circulation Yomiuri newspaper heralded ""a new page in the history of Japanese filmmaking."" Japan is also very much in the backdrop of ""Oppenheimer,"" which won seven Oscars, including best picture. The biopic centers on an American scientist working on the atomic bomb. The film has yet to be released in Japan. ""Perfect Days,"" Wim Wenders' touching film about a sanitation worker, was nominated in the international feature film category but did not win. Japanese actor Koji Yakusho, who portrays a gentle and lonely man who takes photos and cares for plants, won best actor for his performance at Cannes in May last year. ""War is Over,"" which won for short animation, was inspired by Yoko Ono and John Lennon's music. Their son Sean, who co-wrote the film, gave a shout-out to his mother, who is Japanese, at the Academy Awards. Miyazaki celebrated his Oscar win in private at his atelier and did not attend the studio event, Suzuki said. When asked why Miyazaki had shaved off his trademark beard, Suzuki said: ""He doesn't want to look important."" Suzuki said he spent time analyzing why Ghibli's latest film was chosen, wondering if it was because of the Old Testament references in the storyline, which centers on a young boy dealing with his mother's illness and death, and the relationship he develops with a talking bird. Suzuki said Ghibli's hand-drawn illustrations were more effective than computer graphics in portraying the bird's metamorphosis. Ghibli didn't do much publicity for the film, choosing instead a low-key approach for a work that was 10 years in the making and released after Miyazaki was supposedly retired. ""We thought it was OK to make something we really wanted to make,"" said Suzuki. #Ghibli",https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/japanese-animation-studio-founder-miyazaki-isnt-ready-to-retire-just-yet-after-latest-oscar-win,entertainment

Their son Sean, who co-wrote the film, gave a shout-out to his mother, who is Japanese, at the Academy Awards. Miyazaki celebrated his Oscar win in private at his atelier and did not attend the studio event, Suzuki said. When asked why Miyazaki had shaved off his trademark beard, Suzuki said: ""He doesn't want to look important."" Suzuki said he spent time analyzing why Ghibli's latest film was chosen, wondering if it was because of the Old Testament references in the storyline, which centers on a young boy dealing with his mother's illness and death, and the relationship he develops with a talking bird. Suzuki said Ghibli's hand-drawn illustrations were more effective than computer graphics in portraying the bird's metamorphosis. Ghibli didn't do much publicity for the film, choosing instead a low-key approach for a work that was 10 years in the making and released after Miyazaki was supposedly retired. ""We thought it was OK to make something we really wanted to make,"" said Suzuki. #Ghibli",https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/japanese-animation-studio-founder-miyazaki-isnt-ready-to-retire-just-yet-after-latest-oscar-win,entertainment

Taylor Swift struck a deal with Singapore not to perform in any other Southeast Asian country,By Associated Press,"09:37 pm Mar 05, 2024",Himalayn times,"MELBOURNE, MARCH 5 Taylor Swift stole the show at an Asian summit Tuesday when Singapore's leader was prompted to defend his tiny country's exclusive concert deal with the singer that risks bad blood in the region by preventing her from performing in neighboring nations. Related Articles Taylor Swift is demanding this college student stop tracking her private jet Taylor Swift wins album of the year at the Grammy Awards for the fourth time, setting a new record Singapore is a key member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation bloc known as ASEAN. Its three-day summit was expected to focus on member Myanmar's humanitarian crisis and conflicts in the South China Sea. Instead, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was grilled on the summit's sidelines about a lucrative and exclusive deal his city-state struck with Swift that prevents the singer from taking her Eras Tour to any other stop in Southeast Asia. Swift is performing six concerts from March 2 to 9 in Singapore, and some Southeast Asian neighbors complain that the Singapore deal deprives them of the tourism boom her concerts bring to hosts. Her Eras Tour shattered records when it reportedly surpassed $1 billion last year, and her film adaptation of the tour quickly took No. 1 at the box office and became the highest-grossing concert film to date. The Singaporean leader confirmed Tuesday that Swift was provided with ""certain incentives"" in exchange for making Singapore her only Southeast Asian destination on her Eras Tour. Lee defended the deal at a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, a self-professed Swiftie whose Spotify Wrapped list boasted Taylor Swift as his second most streamed artist of 2023. Albanese is hosting the summit in Melbourne, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Australia becoming ASEAN's first external partner. Lee did not reveal the cost of the exclusive deal, which was paid for from a government fund established to rebuild tourism after COVID-19 disruptions. He also did not directly answer when asked if he had encountered bad blood among other leaders due to the deal, instead suggesting that if Singapore hadn't struck an exclusive deal, a neighboring country might have done so. ""It has turned out to be a very successful arrangement. I don't see that as being unfriendly,"" Lee said. Thailand's Prime Minister, Srettha Thavisin, brought attention to the deal in February with a public claim that a promoter told him the Singaporean government subsidized the concerts with around $2 million to $3 million per show with a condition that the artist not play anywhere else in Southeast Asia. Srettha said that if he had known about the deal before, he was confident he would be able to pull off something similar. But Thailand doesn't hold it against Singapore, said Prommin Lertsuridej, the Secretary-General of the Prime Minister. He told reporters in a group interview Monday that Thailand took what Singapore did as an example, and while Thailand already has some laws in place to allow such incentive packages, the government is working to remove red tape and make Thailand a more attractive venue for international events. ""We learn from each other,"" Prommin said, adding that he admired Singapore for being able to come up with and achieve this ""good business idea."" In February, Indonesian Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno took to Instagram to apologize to Swift's fans, saying: ""International music events, such as Taylor Swift concerts, do have a big impact on a country's economy. But I'm sorry Swifties, Taylor Swift hasn't stopped by in Indonesia yet. Bought out by Singapore. However, this is a lesson for us."" Raisa Christy, a 37-year-old fan living in Jakarta, Indonesia, said she regretted that Swift's closest stop by far was in Singapore. However, she believes it's the only spot in the region that has the capabilities and infrastructure that meet Swift's standards. Lee said that, while he didn't know what Australia's arrangements were, he expected it similarly made ""mutually acceptable, sensible arrangements"" with Swift when she performed in Melbourne and Sydney - one of which Australia's prime minister attended - before flying to Singapore. Swift's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Other questions at the news conference covered increasing tensions in the South China Sea, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the likelihood of China joining in a regional free trade pact. #Taylor Swift",https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-struck-a-deal-with-singapore-not-to-perform-in-any-other-southeast-asian-country,entertainment

Fasting at school? More Muslim students in the US are getting support during Ramadan,By Associated Press,"09:18 pm Mar 17, 2024",Himalayn times,"DEARBORN, MARCH 17 While Muslim students remain a rarity in many US school districts, they are a major presence in some communities, prompting public schools to be more attentive to their needs during the holy month of Ramadan when dawn-to-sundown fasting is a duty of Islam. Related Articles School textbooks to be supplied before students' enrolment Families of hostages held in Gaza despair as Ramadan cease-fire deadline passes For example, in Dearborn, Michigan - where nearly half the 110,000 residents are of Arab descent - public school teachers and staff strive to make things easier for students observing Ramadan. ""We allow students on their own to practice their faith as long as it's not a disruption to the school day,"" said Dearborn Schools spokesperson David Mustonen. ""We also try to find other spaces or activities in the school during lunch for those students who may be fasting."" But he stressed that these students are still required to complete all assignments. In St. Paul, Minnesota, East African Elementary Magnet School has set aside space in the library where students who are fasting and don't want to be in the cafeteria can spend the break doing other supervised activities like reading, said principal Abdisalam Adam. The 220-student school opened last fall as part of St. Paul's public schools system, and shares that curriculum, but it also aims to reinforce cultural and linguistic connections with Somalia and other East African countries. Adam said about 90% of the students are Somali Muslims. Adam, who has worked with the district for nearly 30 years, said he tells his staff that accommodating observance of Ramadan fits in with an overall goal of caring for students. ""All needs are connected,"" he said. For school districts less familiar with Muslim traditions, resources are available. For example, Islamic Networks Group, a California-based nonprofit, provides, among other things, online information for educators about Ramadan and its significance to Muslims. Many districts ""don't know very much about Islam or any of our holidays,"" said Maha Elgenaidi, the group's executive director. ""If they don't know very much about it, there's not much they can provide to students in terms of accommodation"" until they learn more and the parents are actively involved in asking for accommodations. She says fasting students may need to be excused from strenuous activities in gym class, and should be allowed to make up for tests missed due to absence to celebrate the Eid al-Fitr holiday that follows Ramadan. ""If they're not accommodated at school or the school doesn't know anything about this, they're kind of living dual lives there."" Fasting is not required of young children, but many Muslim children like to fast to share in the month's rituals and emulate parents and older siblings, according to ING. Educators also need to know of the typical changes to Muslim families' routines during Ramadan, such as waking up for the pre-dawn ""suhoor"" meal and staying up late to possibly attend prayers in the mosque, Elgenaidi said. When Dr. Aifra Ahmed's children were younger, the Pakistani American physician and her husband would share insight about Ramadan with their classmates, reading to them a Ramadan story and distributing goodie bags with such things as dates. ""I realized that the Muslim families in school have to do a lot of education,"" said Ahmed, who lives in Los Altos, California. Ahmed's husband, Moazzam Chaudry, said goodwill gestures, such as when educators offer a Ramadan greeting, send a message of inclusivity. For immigrant families, ""that's the first thing that ... naturally comes to your mind, 'Are we integrated into this society? Does this society even accept us?'"" he said. ""These little, little things make such a huge impact."" Punhal, the couple's daughter who attends a charter middle school, said she takes part in physical education during Ramadan but skips running when fasting because she would need water afterward. She said a few non-Muslim friends told her they would like to fast with her in companionship. Naiel, her brother who's in a public high school, said he was pleased when a teacher talked to the class about Ramadan and told him that, if he needed, he could take a nap. He wants others to better understand why he fasts. ""A lot of kids and teachers think ... I'm torturing myself or like it's a diet,"" he said. ""When I'm fasting, I just feel a lot more gratitude towards everyone around me and towards people who don't have as much."" In Dearborn, 14-year-old Adam Alcodray praised the faculty at Dearborn High for their understanding during Ramadan. ""A lot of the teachers are just like more lenient, allowing us to do less,"" said Alcodray, a 9th grader. ""They don't get mad because they realize we are hungry."" Alcodray says he fasts from 6:20 a.m. until around 8 p.m. ""It's not that bad to be honest,"" he said. ""When you know you can't eat, something in your brain clicks."" Hussein Mortada, a 17-year-old senior at Dearborn High, said family solidarity is invaluable during Ramadan. ""In my family, everybody's fasting,"" Mortada said. ""Everybody's going through the same thing. The whole month is meant for you to get closer to God and make your religion stronger."" This year, Ramadan carries extra significance due to the hardships being suffered by people in Gaza amid the Israel-Hamas war, Mortada said. ""I feel helpless just sitting here on my phone, looking at everything that's happening,"" he said. ""All you can do is feel for them and pray for them."" Alcodray shared similar sentiments. ""When you look at what the children are eating in Gaza, you appreciate what your mom makes,"" he said. ""When you're having a bad day, realize what they are going through."" At the East African magnet school in St. Paul, Marian Aden - who trains other teachers there - makes it a priority to encourage Ramadan-related accommodations for fasting students. Aden said her youngest daughter, 4-year-old Nora, woke up excited about Ramadan's start on March 11 - but her teachers in the suburb where they live weren't familiar with the occasion. Aden said she'll be relieved when Nora starts attending the magnet school next year. ""She'll be celebrated for who she is,"" Aden said.

Still, he wants them to get used to the idea; this year he'd like them to experiment with fasting for a half day. To Fouzi, more important than strict adherence to the rules at their age is their understanding of Ramadan's meaning and the importance of praying for peace.

Fasting at school? More Muslim students in the US are getting support during Ramadan,By Associated Press,"09:18 pm Mar 17, 2024",Himalayn times,"DEARBORN, MARCH 17 While Muslim students remain a rarity in many US school districts, they are a major presence in some communities, prompting public schools to be more attentive to their needs during the holy month of Ramadan when dawn-to-sundown fasting is a duty of Islam. Related Articles School textbooks to be supplied before students' enrolment Families of hostages held in Gaza despair as Ramadan cease-fire deadline passes For example, in Dearborn, Michigan - where nearly half the 110,000 residents are of Arab descent - public school teachers and staff strive to make things easier for students observing Ramadan. ""We allow students on their own to practice their faith as long as it's not a disruption to the school day,"" said Dearborn Schools spokesperson David Mustonen. ""We also try to find other spaces or activities in the school during lunch for those students who may be fasting."" But he stressed that these students are still required to complete all assignments. In St. Paul, Minnesota, East African Elementary Magnet School has set aside space in the library where students who are fasting and don't want to be in the cafeteria can spend the break doing other supervised activities like reading, said principal Abdisalam Adam. The 220-student school opened last fall as part of St. Paul's public schools system, and shares that curriculum, but it also aims to reinforce cultural and linguistic connections with Somalia and other East African countries. Adam said about 90% of the students are Somali Muslims. Adam, who has worked with the district for nearly 30 years, said he tells his staff that accommodating observance of Ramadan fits in with an overall goal of caring for students. ""All needs are connected,"" he said. For school districts less familiar with Muslim traditions, resources are available. For example, Islamic Networks Group, a California-based nonprofit, provides, among other things, online information for educators about Ramadan and its significance to Muslims. Many districts ""don't know very much about Islam or any of our holidays,"" said Maha Elgenaidi, the group's executive director. ""If they don't know very much about it, there's not much they can provide to students in terms of accommodation"" until they learn more and the parents are actively involved in asking for accommodations. She says fasting students may need to be excused from strenuous activities in gym class, and should be allowed to make up for tests missed due to absence to celebrate the Eid al-Fitr holiday that follows Ramadan. ""If they're not accommodated at school or the school doesn't know anything about this, they're kind of living dual lives there."" Fasting is not required of young children, but many Muslim children like to fast to share in the month's rituals and emulate parents and older siblings, according to ING. Educators also need to know of the typical changes to Muslim families' routines during Ramadan, such as waking up for the pre-dawn ""suhoor"" meal and staying up late to possibly attend prayers in the mosque, Elgenaidi said. When Dr. Aifra Ahmed's children were younger, the Pakistani American physician and her husband would share insight about Ramadan with their classmates, reading to them a Ramadan story and distributing goodie bags with such things as dates. ""I realized that the Muslim families in school have to do a lot of education,"" said Ahmed, who lives in Los Altos, California. Ahmed's husband, Moazzam Chaudry, said goodwill gestures, such as when educators offer a Ramadan greeting, send a message of inclusivity. For immigrant families, ""that's the first thing that ... naturally comes to your mind, 'Are we integrated into this society? Does this society even accept us?'"" he said. ""These little, little things make such a huge impact."" Punhal, the couple's daughter who attends a charter middle school, said she takes part in physical education during Ramadan but skips running when fasting because she would need water afterward. She said a few non-Muslim friends told her they would like to fast with her in companionship. Naiel, her brother who's in a public high school, said he was pleased when a teacher talked to the class about Ramadan and told him that, if he needed, he could take a nap. He wants others to better understand why he fasts. ""A lot of kids and teachers think ... I'm torturing myself or like it's a diet,"" he said. ""When I'm fasting, I just feel a lot more gratitude towards everyone around me and towards people who don't have as much."" In Dearborn, 14-year-old Adam Alcodray praised the faculty at Dearborn High for their understanding during Ramadan. ""A lot of the teachers are just like more lenient, allowing us to do less,"" said Alcodray, a 9th grader. ""They don't get mad because they realize we are hungry."" Alcodray says he fasts from 6:20 a.m. until around 8 p.m. ""It's not that bad to be honest,"" he said. ""When you know you can't eat, something in your brain clicks."" Hussein Mortada, a 17-year-old senior at Dearborn High, said family solidarity is invaluable during Ramadan. ""In my family, everybody's fasting,"" Mortada said. ""Everybody's going through the same thing. The whole month is meant for you to get closer to God and make your religion stronger."" This year, Ramadan carries extra significance due to the hardships being suffered by people in Gaza amid the Israel-Hamas war, Mortada said. ""I feel helpless just sitting here on my phone, looking at everything that's happening,"" he said. ""All you can do is feel for them and pray for them."" Alcodray shared similar sentiments. ""When you look at what the children are eating in Gaza, you appreciate what your mom makes,"" he said. ""When you're having a bad day, realize what they are going through."" At the East African magnet school in St. Paul, Marian Aden - who trains other teachers there - makes it a priority to encourage Ramadan-related accommodations for fasting students. Aden said her youngest daughter, 4-year-old Nora, woke up excited about Ramadan's start on March 11 - but her teachers in the suburb where they live weren't familiar with the occasion. Aden said she'll be relieved when Nora starts attending the magnet school next year. ""She'll be celebrated for who she is,"" Aden said.

Sustainability and existential philosophy on display,By Himalayan News Service,"02:49 pm Mar 14, 2024",Himalayn times,"KATHMANDU The Kala Salon in Thamel is currently the epicentre of artistic discourse in the Valley as it hosts two thought-provoking exhibitions, 'Foraging Chroma' by Meena Gurung, and 'From Zero to Sunya' by Cinzia, which commenced on March 10. Related Articles Sudan's conflict risks creating the world's largest hunger crisis, the top UN food official warns The Phoenix: Jessica's journey from the brink of death Foraging Chroma is a visual narrative by artist Gurung, who, as the founder of Bora Studio, is celebrated for her sustainable fashion initiatives and ethical practices. The exhibition is a vivid reflection of nature's palette, with 60 pieces adorning the ground floor of the gallery. Gurung's collection is a testament to the vibrant hues she unearths through foraging. Each piece is a story woven in colour, creating a visual symphony. The artworks, crafted from silk, cotton, and nylon, undergo a transformation through botanical printing and natural dyeing, employing plant-based dyes indigenous to Nepal's flora. Gurung's pieces are not just an art, they are narratives of sustainability, echoing the art world's growing consciousness towards ecological balance in Nepal. A standout piece is raw silk imprinted with madder roots and leaves from Chimtoshwor, Nuwakot. The madder's natural dye imparts a rich blood-red hue to the silk, forming intricate leaf and stem patterns. This piece, akin to a muffler, suggests an embrace with nature, a fusion of art and wearer. Gurung said, ""Natural dyes like those from madder roots are biodegradable and non-polluting, aligning with my commitment to art that respects the environment and promotes ecological balance. It's a way to connect with the past while also ensuring that these methods continue to have relevance in the present and future."" Another artwork features raw silk printed with an array of botanicals from Chitwan - malati, cosmos, hibiscus, peepal, and marigold - each bringing its unique hue to the fabric, immortalising the flora in a tapestry of colour. Photo Courtesy: Chakshita Meanwhile, cotton dyed with an iron bath and printed with onion skin, guava leaves, and wild leaves from Madi, Chitwan, resulting in a golden-brown colour that evokes a sense of warmth similar to being embraced by nature. Gurung reflected, ""As Nepali, we carry the duty to protect our nature. We must acknowledge the gifts nature gives us, from medicine to food, and embrace sustainable living to give back for its kindness."" Multivisual artist Cinzia from Italy presents, From Zero to Sunya, an exhibition that transcends mere visual art to become a philosophical odyssey. This showcase compels visitors to think about the profound concept of Sunya, a Sanskrit term denoting emptiness or void. Cinzia's masterful use of space and a minimalist aesthetic invite onlookers to seek meaning within the absence, echoing the contemplative traditions of both eastern and western thought. Over 100 artworks - including jewellery, sculptures, installations, and photographs - employ diverse materials like brass, copper, steel, springs, and coils, filling the first floor of the gallery with a tangible sense of exploration. Cinzia herself articulated the essence of her work, as she stated, ""The space and minimalist approach challenge the audience to find meaning in the void, an endeavour that resonates deeply with both eastern and western philosophies."" Indeed, navigating through her creations, one is enveloped by a serene peace and a refreshing novelty. The artworks, abundant with maritime elements such as shells, Caribbean Sea photos, crab-structured pieces, and driftwood, evoke a sense of renewal. The exhibition features an array of pieces, from abstract works that leverage negative space for visual impact to tangible sculptures that prompt introspection about the physical space they inhabit. Cinzia's artistry fosters a conversation about the unseen and the significance of emptiness, urging a reassessment of our perception of the surrounding world. For instance, a photograph of the Mediterranean Sea transports viewers to the Italian coast, where one can almost feel the sea's breeze and embrace the vastness of the horizon. Another notable sculpture, Purusha Prakriti, crafted from cardboard, newspapers, and metal mesh rescued from construction sites, depicts a woman's form in earthy tones, encircled by leaves - a representation of Sunya that evokes a profound connection to nature and the cosmos. Cinzia said, ""In the silence of Sunya, we find the echoes of creation. My art is a dance with the void, where each step unveils the universe's hidden symphony."" The simultaneous hosting of From Zero to Sunya and Foraging Chroma at Kala Salon is a bold statement on the fluidity of art. While these exhibitions may appear diametrically opposed, they are bound by a shared quest to comprehend our existence within the cosmos. Cinzia delves into the metaphysical, while Gurung's work revels in the physicality of our world. Together, they present a comprehensive experience that is both intellectually stimulating and aesthetically pleasing. Sophia Pande, the founding director of The Kala Salon, reflected, ""Both showcases aim to redefine our perception of art. Cinzia's jewellery and Meena's hand-dyed shawls are wearable art forms, no less significant than traditional paintings.

"Rupert Murdoch, 92, plans to marry for 5th time",By Associated Press,"09:31 pm Mar 10, 2024",Himalayn times,"LONDON, MARCH 10 Media magnate Rupert Murdoch, who turns 93 next week, has been married four times - and is engaged again, his representative said Saturday. Related Articles Hopes dim for a truce ahead of Ramadan as Gaza negotiations to continue next week US company's lunar lander rockets toward the moon for a touchdown attempt next week He plans to marry Elena Zhukova, 67, a Russian-born retired scientist he met last year. Her ex-husband Alexander Zhukov is a billionaire energy investor and Russian politician. Their daughter Dasha was previously married to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who used to own the Premier League football club Chelsea. Last fall Murdoch stepped down as leader of both Fox News' parent company and his News Corp. media holdings - and his son, Lachlan, took his place in a media empire that spans continents and helped to shape modern American politics. In 1952, Murdoch inherited a newspaper in his native Australia from his father. Over decades, he built a news and entertainment enterprise that became dominant in the United States and Britain, including ownership of such historic newspapers as The Times of London and The Wall Street Journal. Fox News Channel, the 24-hour network founded in 1996, has profoundly influenced television, becoming a trusted news source among many conservative U.S. audiences and politicians.

What is Ramadan and how do Muslims observe the Islamic holy month?,By Associated Press,"10:56 pm Mar 08, 2024",Himalayn times,"CAIRO, MARCH 8 Observant Muslims the world over will soon be united in a ritual of daily fasting from dawn to sunset as the Islamic holy month of Ramadan starts. Related Articles Indonesian voters choose a new president in one of the world's largest elections We could see the world's 1st trillionaire in the next decade. Here are some of today's richest 1% For Muslims, it's a time of increased worship, charity and good deeds. Socially, it often brings families and friends together in festive gatherings around meals to break their fast. Ramadan is followed by the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr. This year, Ramadan comes as the latest Israel-Hamas war has killed thousands of Palestinians, left much of Gaza in ruins and created a humanitarian catastrophe, with many Palestinians there, especially in the devastated northern region, scrambling for food to survive. Some Muslims have been brainstorming how to remain mindful of the Palestinians' plight during Ramadan, including through making donations, saying prayers or incorporating Palestinian traditional symbols in how they mark the holy month. WHEN IS RAMADAN? Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar; the month cycles through the seasons. The start of the month traditionally depends on the sighting of the crescent moon; this year, the first day is expected to be on or around March 11. Muslim communities may start Ramadan on different days, due to declarations by multiple Islamic authorities around the globe on whether the crescent has been sighted or different methodologies used to determine the start of the month. WHY AND HOW DO MUSLIMS FAST? Fasting is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, along with the profession of faith, prayer, almsgiving, and pilgrimage. Muslims see various meanings and lessons in observing the fast. It's regarded as an act of worship to attain God-conscious piety and one of submission to God. The devout see benefits including practicing self-restraint, cultivating gratitude, growing closer to God, and feeling for the poor and hungry. The daily fast in Ramadan includes abstaining from all food and drink; not even a sip of water is allowed from dawn to sunset before breaking the fast in a meal known as ""iftar"" in Arabic. Those fasting are expected to also refrain from bad deeds, such as gossiping, and increase good deeds. Muslims typically stream into mosques for congregational prayers and dedicate more time for religious contemplation and the reading of the Quran, the Muslim holy book. Charity is a hallmark of Ramadan. Among other ways of giving, many seek to provide iftar for the needy, distributing Ramadan boxes filled with pantry staples, handing out warm meals alongside such things as dates and juice or helping hold free communal meals. Muslims eat a pre-dawn meal, called ""suhoor,"" to hydrate and nurture their bodies ahead of the daily fast. ARE THERE EXEMPTIONS FROM FASTING? Yes. There are certain exemptions from fasting, such as for those who are unable to because of illness or travel. Those unable to fast due to being temporarily ill or traveling need to make up for the missed days of fasting later. WHAT ARE SOME CULTURAL AND SOCIAL TRADITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH RAMADAN? Muslims are ethnically and racially diverse and not all Ramadan traditions are rooted in religion. Some customs may transcend borders, while others can differ across cultures. Many social rituals center on gathering and socializing after the daily fast. Some Muslims decorate their homes, put out Ramadan-themed tableware and centerpieces or throng to markets and Ramadan bazaars. In Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, Ramadan is typically a festive time. Colorful lanterns, in different shapes and sizes, dangle from children's hands and adorn homes or the entrances of buildings and stores. Ramadan songs may be played to welcome the month. So-called Ramadan tents, featuring food and entertainment, pop up to cater to gatherings. Ramadan's soundscape in Egypt has traditionally included the pre-dawn banging on drums by a ""mesaharati"" who roams neighborhoods, calling out to the faithful, sometimes by name, to awake them for the suhoor meal. NEW TV SHOWS, COMMUNAL MEALS A line-up of new television shows is another fixture of the month in some countries, and advertisers compete for the attention of viewers. In various regions, some Muslims worry that the month is being commercialized, and that an emphasis on decorations, TV shows, outings or lavish iftar banquets, especially in the social media era, can detract from Ramadan's religious essence. Others feel that a balance can be struck and that, done in moderation, such rituals are part of the month's festive spirit. In Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country, Ramadan rituals vary across regions, with some influenced by local cultures or other faith traditions. Thousands of villagers who live on the slopes of Mount Merapi in Central Java welcome Ramadan with Nyadran, a Javanese ritual influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism that includes visiting, cleaning and decorating ancestors' graves. People in Indonesia's deeply conservative Aceh province slaughter animals during Meugang festivities. The meat is cooked and shared in a communal feast with family, friends, the poor and orphans. Hundreds of residents in Tangerang, a city just outside the capital of Jakarta, flock to the Cisadane River to wash their hair with rice straw shampoo and welcome the fasting month with a symbolic spiritual cleansing. After evening prayers, many boys and girls across Sumatra island parade through the streets. They carry torches and play Islamic songs. In India, home to more than 200 million Muslims making up a large minority group in the country, stalls lining many streets sell such things as dates, sweets and freshly cooked food. At night, some New Delhi neighborhoods become lively as Muslims head to mosques to attend prayers. Some Indian Muslims also visit holy shrines dedicated to Sufi saints, which are decorated with lights and colorful flowers. In the United States, home to a diverse, small but growing Muslim population, gathering at mosques and Islamic centers when possible for iftar meals and prayers provides many Muslim families with a sense of community. Some Muslims also organize or attend interfaith iftar meals. Some big US retailers have started catering to Ramadan shoppers, selling such things as Ramadan-themed decor. #Ramadan #Eid al-Fitr #Islamic holy month of Ramadan",https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/what-is-ramadan-and-how-do-muslims-observe-the-islamic-holy-month,lifestyle

"Chopin lovers can't meet their hero, but this pianist got to do the next best thing",By Associated Press,"02:50 pm Mar 06, 2024",Himalayn times,"WARSAW, MARCH 6 Pianist Eric Guo did everything but travel through time to commune with Chopin. Related Articles Gandaki Province to scrap 25-year-old private vehicles We could see the world's 1st trillionaire in the next decade. Here are some of today's richest 1% On March 1, the day celebrated as Frederic Chopin's birthday, the 21-year-old Canadian played one concert at the birthplace of the Romantic-era piano virtuoso and composer, on a piano built during his lifetime. Then he went into town for a second performance, during which he used a piano that once belonged to Chopin. ""You cannot get more connected to Chopin than being in his birth place,"" said Guo. A student at the The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Guo was invited to give the special performances to mark Chopin's 214th birthday after winning the second Frederic Chopin Competition on Period Instruments. He gave a pair of recitals on the day, one at the manor house in Zelazowa Wola where Chopin was born in 1810, now a museum, and the other at the National Philharmonic in Warsaw. ""It's probably exactly the same room he was born in, so, it's, you know, spiritual connection,"" Guo said. ""I really feel one with Chopin."" Poland's Fryderyk Chopin Institute - which uses the Polish spelling of the composer's name - began the period instrument competition in 2018 to promote historically informed performances of Chopin's music that use 19th century pianos or modern reproductions. It's held every five years. It's part of a wider trend toward period instruments, as experts and audiences try to figure out what the music pieces sounded like to their own composers. Some claim that changes in how instruments are designed and played nowadays have erased subtleties in the music; others just enjoy a new spin on familiar classics. Pianos made in the 18th and 19th century were simpler, lighter and smaller than modern instruments, with narrower keys and lighter strings. The result is they play more softly than modern pianos. ""These period pianos, they all have the ability to play as soft as possible and I think still there's something there, there is still a core inside,"" Guo told The Associated Press last weekend. In a period instrument ""I like the colors that it can create and the sound is, you know, out of this world,"" said Guo. Modern pianos, by contrast, tend to prioritize strong, powerful sound, he said. Contemporary grand pianos are reinforced with metal to withstand the force of much tauter and thicker strings and larger and more complex hammers mechanisms, for a sound that carries well in large concert halls, but also has a different quality. Guo enjoys playing both. ""It works both ways: the period helps the modern and vice versa."" In Warsaw, Guo performed a solo version of Chopin's Concerto in F Minor on a contemporary replica of an 1830 Pleyel piano made by Paul McNulty, and the Preludes on Chopin's last piano, an 1848 Pleyel. Chopin's own piano, Guo said, has a ""velvet"" sound and makes it possible to get the ""kind of touch that Chopin would have really sought."" Chopin's music demands subtlety from both instrument and performer, Guo said. ""He always emphasized that everything should be with ease and always free, and never to produce a hard sound, and never for the sake of virtuosity. Virtuosity, technique serves the music."" That's not to say the music is easy. ""Chopin knew about the piano and he wrote for the piano"" and a lot of his work is ""just technically taxing, exhausting, he really demands a lot,"" Guo said. Whether Chopin was actually born on the day he celebrated as his birthday is a matter of some dispute among his biographers. His birth certificate bears the date Feb. 22, 1810, but his family celebrated on March 1. Chopin was considered a musical genius from an early age, and in 1830 left Warsaw for Vienna to broaden his education and his audience. He eventually settled in Paris, giving concerts, teaching the piano and composing music, some based on Polish dances like the polonaise and the mazurka. He died on Oct. 17, 1849 and was buried at the Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris. His heart is at the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw. Guo said people in the tumultuous 21st century need music more than ever. ""All those wars going on, fights: music really bonds us, unites us as a humanity and society. Kind of heals us, cures all the stresses and all the challenges."" Following his competition win in Warsaw in October, Guo's schedule is busy with concerts from Japan to European countries, to the United States. He's hoping to finalize plans for concerts in China, his family's ancestral home, this fall. ""Schedules are quite packed and yes, more than before, but I'm still who I am, you know, I'm still living, surviving, and I'm human still, despite everything."" #Pianist Eric Guo #Chopin",https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/chopin-lovers-cant-meet-their-hero-but-this-pianist-got-to-do-the-next-best-thing,lifestyle

Contemporary grand pianos are reinforced with metal to withstand the force of much tauter and thicker strings and larger and more complex hammers mechanisms, for a sound that carries well in large concert halls, but also has a different quality. Guo enjoys playing both. ""It works both ways: the period helps the modern and vice versa."" In Warsaw, Guo performed a solo version of Chopin's Concerto in F Minor on a contemporary replica of an 1830 Pleyel piano made by Paul McNulty, and the Preludes on Chopin's last piano, an 1848 Pleyel. Chopin's own piano, Guo said, has a ""velvet"" sound and makes it possible to get the ""kind of touch that Chopin would have really sought."" Chopin's music demands subtlety from both instrument and performer, Guo said. ""He always emphasized that everything should be with ease and always free, and never to produce a hard sound, and never for the sake of virtuosity. Virtuosity, technique serves the music."" That's not to say the music is easy. ""Chopin knew about the piano and he wrote for the piano"" and a lot of his work is ""just technically taxing, exhausting, he really demands a lot,"" Guo said. Whether Chopin was actually born on the day he celebrated as his birthday is a matter of some dispute among his biographers. His birth certificate bears the date Feb. 22, 1810, but his family celebrated on March 1. Chopin was considered a musical genius from an early age, and in 1830 left Warsaw for Vienna to broaden his education and his audience. He eventually settled in Paris, giving concerts, teaching the piano and composing music, some based on Polish dances like the polonaise and the mazurka. He died on Oct. 17, 1849 and was buried at the Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris. His heart is at the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw. Guo said people in the tumultuous 21st century need music more than ever. ""All those wars going on, fights: music really bonds us, unites us as a humanity and society. Kind of heals us, cures all the stresses and all the challenges."" Following his competition win in Warsaw in October, Guo's schedule is busy with concerts from Japan to European countries, to the United States. He's hoping to finalize plans for concerts in China, his family's ancestral home, this fall. ""Schedules are quite packed and yes, more than before, but I'm still who I am, you know, I'm still living, surviving, and I'm human still, despite everything."" #Pianist Eric Guo #Chopin",https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/chopin-lovers-cant-meet-their-hero-but-this-pianist-got-to-do-the-next-best-thing,lifestyle

"Chopin lovers can't meet their hero, but this pianist got to do the next best thing",By Associated Press,"02:50 pm Mar 06, 2024",Himalayn times,"WARSAW, MARCH 6 Pianist Eric Guo did everything but travel through time to commune with Chopin. Related Articles Gandaki Province to scrap 25-year-old private vehicles We could see the world's 1st trillionaire in the next decade. Here are some of today's richest 1% On March 1, the day celebrated as Frederic Chopin's birthday, the 21-year-old Canadian played one concert at the birthplace of the Romantic-era piano virtuoso and composer, on a piano built during his lifetime. Then he went into town for a second performance, during which he used a piano that once belonged to Chopin. ""You cannot get more connected to Chopin than being in his birth place,"" said Guo. A student at the The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Guo was invited to give the special performances to mark Chopin's 214th birthday after winning the second Frederic Chopin Competition on Period Instruments. He gave a pair of recitals on the day, one at the manor house in Zelazowa Wola where Chopin was born in 1810, now a museum, and the other at the National Philharmonic in Warsaw. ""It's probably exactly the same room he was born in, so, it's, you know, spiritual connection,"" Guo said. ""I really feel one with Chopin."" Poland's Fryderyk Chopin Institute - which uses the Polish spelling of the composer's name - began the period instrument competition in 2018 to promote historically informed performances of Chopin's music that use 19th century pianos or modern reproductions. It's held every five years. It's part of a wider trend toward period instruments, as experts and audiences try to figure out what the music pieces sounded like to their own composers. Some claim that changes in how instruments are designed and played nowadays have erased subtleties in the music; others just enjoy a new spin on familiar classics. Pianos made in the 18th and 19th century were simpler, lighter and smaller than modern instruments, with narrower keys and lighter strings. The result is they play more softly than modern pianos. ""These period pianos, they all have the ability to play as soft as possible and I think still there's something there, there is still a core inside,"" Guo told The Associated Press last weekend.

"Meta Platforms must face advertisers' class action, US appeals court says",By Reuters,"09:53 am Mar 22, 2024",Himalayn times,"A divided U.S. appeals court said Meta Platforms (META.O), must face a class action by advertisers that accused the Facebook and Instagram owner of overcharging them by fraudulently inflating the number of people their ads might reach. In a 2-1 decision on Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said advertisers could sue for damages as a group over Meta's claims about the ""potential reach"" of their ads. Related Articles Denying same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, a Japanese high court says NEPSE halts trading after three consecutive circuit breaks Advertisers said the metric used measured the number social media accounts, not the lower number of actual people, and inflated the number of potential viewers by as much as 400%. The court also decertified a separate class seeking injunctive relief, meaning the advertisers cannot sue as a group, because it wasn't clear that the main plaintiff had legal standing to sue. A dissenting judge would have decertified both classes. The advertisers have estimated Meta could owe more than $7 billion of damages, court papers show. Meta and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Menlo Park, California-based company has said ads generate ""substantially all,"" of its revenue, which totaled $134.9 billion in 2023. Net income was $39.1 billion. Class actions afford potentially greater recoveries at lower cost than if plaintiffs are forced to sue individually. Circuit Judge Sidney Thomas wrote for the majority that because Meta provided the same alleged misrepresentation about potential reach, advertisers could try to prove that their alleged damages stemmed from a ""common course of conduct."" The class covers potentially millions of individuals and businesses that have paid for ads on Facebook and Instagram since Aug. 15, 2014. Their lawsuit included a claim that senior executives knew that duplicate and fake accounts, including from bots, inflated the ""potential reach"" metric, but took steps to cover it up. Circuit Judge Danielle Forrest, in a partial dissent, said she would decertify the damages class because of individualized questions about what advertisers understood about what Meta was telling them before they bought ads. Geoffrey Graber, a lawyer for the advertisers, said he looked forward to taking the damages case to a jury.

One Tech Tip: Don't use rice for your device. Here's how to dry out your smartphone,By Associated Press,"03:52 pm Feb 29, 2024",Himalayn times,"LONDON, FEBRUARY 29 You were walking next to a swimming pool when you slipped and dropped your phone into the water. Or it slipped out of your hand when you were next to a filled bathtub or toilet. Related Articles Declan Rice returns to haunt West Ham as Arsenal powers to 6-0 win. Saka gains some redemption Rice production decreases in Sarlahi However your smartphone got wet, you now need to dry it. But what do you do? There's lots of advice on the internet, some of it conflicting. Apple inserted itself into the debate recently when it put out an advisory that included a warning against using rice. Here are some things to keep in mind next time your phone has an unintended encounter with a liquid. What you should do Dry off the exterior with a towel or clean cloth, even your shirtsleeve - anything that's absorbent. Take out the SIM card and holder. If possible, remove the back housing and battery to wipe them dry. Also, if possible, turn the phone off. iPhones can't be disassembled so Apple recommends tapping it gently against your hand with the connector ports facing down so liquid can flow out. Samsung, which is the biggest maker of Android phones, recommends using a cotton bud to get moisture out of the earphone jack and charging port. In contrast, Apple says cotton buds shouldn't be inserted into iPhone openings. If it's not water but another liquid - a drink, seawater or chlorinated pool water - Samsung advises soaking the phone in clean water for a few minutes then rinsing it to get rid of any impurities or salinity that could speed up corrosion of the circuitry inside. Both companies say it's best to leave the phone out in a well ventilated area (perhaps with a fan) to dry it out. Google says leave the device to dry at room temperature. What you shouldn't do Don't use a hair dryer or compressed air on your phone. Don't put it in a freezer - this might stop your device from short-circuiting but the problem will be back once you try to thaw it. And while this might seem obvious, don't put your device in a tumble dryer or on top of a radiator. Don't power it up or try to charge it with a cable - although wireless charging is OK if your phone has it and you really need to turn it on in an emergency. So what about using rice to dry your device? You may have heard that putting a phone in a bowl of rice will help draw out moisture. It's been a tip that's been out there for years. Apple, however, says that's a no-no. The company warned against it in an advisory published in early January. It drew little attention at the time, but then people noticed the line that said: ""Don't put your iPhone in a bag of rice. Doing so could allow small particles of rice to damage your iPhone."" Is there anything I can use besides rice? The best option is silica gel, a drying agent that can absorb lots of moisture. Silica gel beads are typically found in packets that are included with products like beef jerky, seaweed sheets or sneakers to keep them dry. You can also buy them in bulk online. This works best if you put them in an airtight box with your phone. When do I know it's dry? It's hard to tell but it's best to wait as long as possible - at least a few days. Samsung advises bringing your device into a service center for inspection even after it's been air-dried. Aren't phones waterproof nowadays? Most phones nowadays are designed to be water-resistant, which means they can resist water entering critical areas for a certain amount of time. But beware, this isn't the same as being waterproof. Apple says the iPhone 7 and and newer models are splash and water resistant. iPhone XS devices and up have the IP68 rating, which means they can be submerged for as long as 30 minutes and, depending on the model, as deep as 6 meters (20 feet). These models also pop up a warning if there's liquid detected in key ports, and warn against charging. Samsung says most of its Galaxy Android phones feature the same rating, though the maximum depth is about 5 meters (16 feet). Google's newer Pixel phones carry the same water resistance ratings, but Google warns that they aren't waterproof and the water resistance will diminish over time because of ""normal wear and tear, device repair, disassembly or damage."" #smartphones",https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-and-tech/one-tech-tip-dont-use-rice-for-your-device-heres-how-to-dry-out-your-smartphone,science-and-tech

"Lumbini is the fountain of Buddhism, DPM Shrestha says",By Rastriya Samachar Samiti,"10:09 am Mar 22, 2024",Himalayn times,"LUMBINI, MARCH 22 Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha has said Lumbini is the fountain of Buddhism besides being the birthplace of Buddha and there can be no better choice of venue than Lumbini to deliberate on the agenda of peace and prosperity. ""The Buddha, Buddhism and Lumbini are integral. Buddhism cannot be differentiated from the Buddha; it cannot be dissociated from Lumbini,"" he added. Inaugurating the International Conclave on Global Peace for Prosperity in Lumbini on Thursday, the Deputy Prime Minister said Buddha and Lumbini have spread messages for the establishment of world peace. The peace, harmony and compassion are the innate attributes that we have inherited from Gautam Buddha and the teachings of Buddha on compassion, kindness and empathy are timeless and continue to be relevant today, the Deputy Prime Minister argued. He said Lumbini, the revered place, gave birth to the message of peace and the messenger, who dedicated his life in the quest for humanity's happiness, well-being, and emancipation. Being hosted jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Honorary Consular Corps Nepal (HCCN), the conclave has witnessed participation of ambassadors and representatives from diplomatic missions in Nepal, honourary consul generals, consuls of different countries for Nepal, experts on foreign affairs and heritage, and others.
